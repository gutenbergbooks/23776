<h4>TO THE</h4>

<h1>READER.</h1>

<p><span class = "firstletter">M</span>AN, the Abridgement of the
Creation, or the <em>Compendium</em> of all Gods Works, having divested
himself by Sin of that Original Innocence and Angelical State of Life
wherein his Creator had placed him, and thereby Subjected his collapsed
Nature to the Malediction of God, <em>In the sweat of thy Face thou
shalt eat thy Bread</em>, &amp;c. It pleased however the Almighty to
continue and confirm that Original
<span class = "folionum">||</span>
grand <em>Charter</em> he had at first granted him, of being <em>Lord of
the Creatures</em>: Hereby intimating, That tho man is now <em>Born to
Trouble, Labour <i>and Cares</i>, as the Sparks fly upward</em>; yet God
has not deprived him of any Comfort or Felicity, which the Earth or
Creatures of it can afford; but has invested him with a superior
Authority and <em>Dominion over the Beast of the Feild, the Fowl of the
Air, and the Fish of the Sea</em>. Thus it comes to pass, that every
Creature payes a <em>Duty and a Subjection</em>, (as it were) to man, as
to their <em>Master</em>; and notwithstanding the Ferocity and
Salvageness of their Natures, become tame and submissive to the
<em>Empire</em> of Man. They court his Favour and
<span class = "folionum">A4</span>
mutely supplicate his Friendship and Confederacy, for the subduing the
Enemies of their several <em>Species</em>: They readily obey his
Precepts, and ravisht with his Service willingly execute his Commands.
And thus by this prime Priviledg from God, Man is allowed the Liberty of
subduing the Creature, and recreating his Mind by <em>Hunting, Fowling,
Fishing</em> and the like; and by observing the Natural
<em>Instincts</em> of every Species, the innate <em>Enmity and
Cunning</em> of every Creature, may glorify the Immense Wisdom of his
Creator.</p>

<p>And as the Liberty of Recreation in lawful Exercises is thus
<em>Naturall</em>, so is it highly <em>Necessary</em> and Useful too.
Recreation keeps up the strength and Alacrity of the
<span class = "folionum">||</span>
bodily Forces, without which the Soul cannot work: I&nbsp;mean those
brisk and violent Exercises, which the Following sheets specifie. They
cause the Body to <em>transpire</em> plentiful sweats, and exhale those
black and fuliginous Vapours which too much oppress some men, and remove
the Obstructions which hinder the Circulation of Nature. <em>Brisk
Exercises</em> render a man Active, Vigorous, Strong, and Hardy, and
attenuate and disperse that <em>Stagnation</em> of humors, Benummedness
and Dulness, which <em>Idleness</em> contracts: Nay, (as one excellently
observes) divers bodily Infirmities, Diseases and Undecencies are hereby
regulated and amended: <em>Riding</em> was used by the great
<em>Drusus</em> for the Strengthening his weak and small
<span class = "folionum">||</span>
Thighs and Legs; and by his late <em>Majesty</em>, especially after
Dinner; and is also good for the Head: <em>Shooting in a long Bow</em>
for the Breast and Arms; and helps Squinting: <em>Bowling</em> for the
Reins, Stone, Gravel, <em>&amp;c.</em></p>

<p>Nor are the several other <em>Games</em> commonly practised, less
<em>Commendable</em>, were they used with a <em>modest</em> and
<em>prudent</em> Care: I&nbsp;recomend them as useful as the other, were
a <em>right use</em> made of them. I&nbsp;would not have them made a
<em>Trade</em>, instead of a <em>Divertisement</em>. But especially
those that are managed by <em>Skill</em>, and not Fortune, may be
Learned, for these acquaint a man with <em>Numbring</em>, and quicken
the Fancy and Memory, and recreate the Mind.</p>

<span class = "folionum">||</span>
<p>And as Recreation is thus natural and necessary, so is it
<em>Commendable</em> too, and recommended by the Practises of all Ages;
as well sacred as prophane Histories plainly testifying the Truth of it.
But I shall not trouble you any longer by detaining you at the Door, and
enumerating the various <em>Examples</em>, which may Authorize a
vertuous Use of Recreations, and apologize for this Work: The severest
<em>Stoick</em> being never so cruel to himself or Nature, as not to
give his mind some <em>Relaxation</em>, and recreate it in some more
pleasant Pathes, than the miry heavy wayes of his own sullen and wilful
<em>Resolutions</em>. Nor do our <em>Modern Stoicks</em>, tho of the
strictest Lives, deny themselves some <em>Mental</em>, if
<span class = "folionum">||</span>
not bodily Recreations; altho perhaps <em>Infirmity</em>, <em>Age</em>,
<em>Station</em>, <em>Degree</em>, <ins class = "correction" title =
"printed in roman (emphatic) type">may</ins> render their Divertisements
the more <em>private</em>, yet not totally denyed. <em>Solomon</em> had
his <em>Ittan</em> for Recreations, as <em>Josephus</em> informes us,
and the <em>Heathen</em> Sages their <em>Olympiques</em>, wherein were
exercised, <em>Wrestling</em>, <em>Running</em> with <em>Horses</em>,
<em>Leaping</em>, <em>Coursing</em> with <em>Chariots</em>,
<em>Contention of Poets</em>, <em>Rhetoricians</em>, <em>Disputations of
Phylosophers</em>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>And because <em>Velle suum cuique</em>, every Mans Nature claimes a
special Prerogative, in the electing a Recreation <em>Suitable</em> to
it self, one thing being very pleasing and delightful to one, and
offensive and troublesome to another, I&nbsp;have
<span class = "folionum">||</span>
therefore like the industrious <em>Bee</em> gathered <em>Honey</em> from
various <em>Flowers</em>, and according to your <em>Palate</em> taste
and Eat; I&nbsp;have carefully <em>Delineated</em> and drawn to the Life
the divers <em>Figures</em> of the several Recreations, and leave you to
admire that <em>Peice</em> you fancy best; intreating you to put them to
the best <em>Use</em>, not to make them your Trade instead of
<em>Recreation</em>; in which sence I would have you to accept this: And
now you may walk in and view the Structure.</p>

that challenges the sublime Epithets of <i>Royal</i>, <i>Artificial</i>,
<i>Manly</i>, and <i>Warlike</i>, for its Stateliness, Cunning, and
Indurance, claims above all other Sports the Precedency; and therefore I
was induced to place it at the Head to usher in the rest; and of which
take this concise Definition, <i>viz.</i> That since Nature has equally
imparted unto every Beast a wonderful Knowledge of <i>Offence</i> and
<i>Security</i>, herein we may observe, <i>The curious Search and
Conquest of one Creature over another, hurried on by an innate natural
Antipathy, and performed or wrought by a Distinction of Smells.</i></p>

<p>And now to come to the Purpose, and the Design of this Tract, briefly
to inform the young <i>Hunter</i>, as yet
<span class = "pagenum">2</span>
raw in the true Knowledge of this <i>Royal Sport</i>, with what is
meerly <i>necessary</i> and <i>useful</i>, without amusing him with
<i>superfluous</i> Observations for his Instruction: I&nbsp;shall
therefore observe throughout this Treatise this Method: 1.&nbsp;The
several <i>Chases</i> or <i>Games</i> which fall under the first
Denomination, <i>Hunting</i>. 2.&nbsp;The genuine or infallible
<i>Rules</i> whereby we are to direct our selves, for the obtaining the
true Pleasure in prosecuting the same, and the desired Effects
of&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>Know then; There are five <i>Beasts of Venery</i> or <i>Forest</i>,
viz. The <i>Hart</i>, <i>Hinde</i>, <i>Hare</i>, <i>Boar</i>,
<i>Wolf</i>.</p>

<p>As likewise five Wild Beasts, or <i>Beasts of Chace</i>, viz. The
<i>Buck</i>, <i>Doe</i>, <i>Fox</i>, <i>Martern</i>, <i>Roe</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Beasts of Warren</i>, are three, <i>viz.</i> <i>Hares</i>,
<i>Coneys</i>, <i>Roes</i>.</p>

<p><i>Note</i>, The <i>Hart</i> and <i>Hinde</i> before spoken of,
though they are of <i>one</i> kind, yet, because their <i>Seasons</i>
are several, are esteemed <i>distinct</i> Beasts; and in the <i>Hart</i>
is included the <i>Stag</i>, and all <i>red Deer</i> of Antlier.</p>

<p>And because I reckon it the most necessary part of the <i>Hunter</i>
to understand the <i>Names</i>, <i>Degrees</i>, <i>Ages</i>, and <ins
class = "correction" title = "‘a’ invisible"><i>Seasons</i></ins> of the
aforesaid different Beasts
<span class = "pagenum">3</span>
<span class = "folionum">B2</span>
of <i>Forest</i> or <i>Venery</i>, <i>Chace</i>, and <i>Warren</i>;
I&nbsp;shall therefore, in the next place, present him with these
following</p>


<h5 class = "ital">Beasts of Forrest, <em>&amp;c.</em></h5>

<p>The <i>Hart</i>, the first Year is called a <i>Hinde-Calf</i>,

<p>The <i>Wild-Boar</i> and <i>Woolf</i>, being no <i>English</i> Chace,
I&nbsp;omit.</p>


<h5 class = "ital">Beasts of Chace.</h5>

<p>The <i>Buck</i>, the first Year is called a <i>Fawn</i>, 2&nbsp;A

<p>As for the <i>Beasts of Warren</i>, the <i>Hare</i> being spoken of
before, little or nothing
<span class = "pagenum">4</span>
is to be said. The <i>Coney</i> is first a <i>Rabbet</i>, and then an
<i>Old Coney</i>.</p>

<!-- missing words supplied from 1696 if matching -->

<p>Thus much for their Names, Degrees<span class = "missing">,</span>
and Ages: Now let us next obser<span class = "missing">ve</span> their
<i>proper Seasons</i> for Hunting.</p>

<p>The <i>Hart</i> or <i>Buck</i>, beginneth <i>fift<span class =

<p>The <i>Fox</i>, from <i>Christmass</i>, and l<span class =

<p>The <i>Hinde</i>, or <i>Doe</i>, from <i>Holy-Rood-Day</i>, till
<i>Candlemas</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Roe-Buck</i>, from <i>Easter</i>, till <i>Michaelmas</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Roe</i>, from <i>Michaelmas</i>, till <i>Candlemas</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Hare</i>, from <i>Michaelmas</i>, to the end of
<i>February</i>.</p>

<p>Thus much I thought fit to speak briefly of the proper <i>Names</i>,
<i>Degrees</i>, <i>Ages</i>, &amp; <i>Seasons</i> of the several Chaces
which we Hunt: But having almost forgot some<span class =
"missing">,</span> I&nbsp;shall insert here, as intending to speak
somewhat of them, and they are the <i>Badger</i>, <i>Otter</i>, and
<i>Wild-Goat</i>; the last being a <i>Welch</i>-Game: Many more there
are which I might here enumerate, but being <i>Forreign</i> Chaces,
I&nbsp;omit, as directing my Discourse to the <i>English-Man</i>.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">5</span>
<span class = "folionum">B3</span>
<p>As for the <i>Terms of Art</i> appropriated to Hunting, as the
Huntsmans <i>Dialect</i>, they are so many and various, that should I go
about to note them here, it would swell my Treatise to too big a Volume;
and therefore I refer you to the <i>Dictionaries</i> which speak of
them. And now I bring you to the second thing I proposed, <i>viz.</i>
The <i>Rules And Measures</i> we are to learn and observe in the
aforementioned Sports or Chaces; and in this we must begin with the
<i>Pursuers or Conquerors</i> of these Chaces, namely;</p>


<h5 class = "ital">Of Hounds.</h5>

<p>There are several kinds of <i>Hounds</i>, endued with Qualities
suitable to the Country where they are bred; and therefore consult his
<i>Country</i>, and you will soon understand his <i>Nature</i> &amp;
<i>Use</i>: As for instance, The <i>Western</i> Counties of
<i>England</i>, and Wood-land, Mountainous Countries, as also
<i>Cheshire</i>, and <i>Lancashire</i>, breed the <i>slow-Hound</i>;
a&nbsp;large great Dog, tall and heavy. <i>Worcestershire</i>,
<i>Bedfordshire</i>, and many other well mixt Soyls, where the Champaign
and Covert are equally large, produce the <i>Middle-sized Dog</i>; of a
more nimble
<span class = "pagenum">6</span>
Composure than the fore-mentioned, and fitter for Chace.
<i>Yorkshire</i>, <i>Cumberland</i>, <i>Northumberland</i>, and the
<i>North</i> parts, breed the Light, Nimble, <i>swift slender Dog</i>.
And our open Champaigns train up excellent <i>Grey-Hounds</i>, hugely
admired for his Swiftness, Strength, and Sagacity. And lastly, the
<i>little Beagle</i> bred in all Countries, is of exceeding Cunning, and
curious Scent in Hunting. All these Dogs are highly set by in all remote
Parts, whose Princes and Lords tenderly cherish them as
<i>Excellencies</i>, and ambitiously sue for as <i>Rarities</i>.</p>

<p>For the <i>Choice</i> of Hounds we are to rely much on their
<i>Colours</i>, and accordingly make our Election. The Best and most
Beautiful of all for a general Kennel, is, The <i>White Hound</i>, with
black Ears, and a black spot at the setting on of the Tail, and is ever
found to be both of good Scent, and good Condition, and will Hunt any
Chace, but especially the <i>Hare</i>, <i>Stag</i>, <i>Buck</i>,
<i>Roe</i>, or <i>Otter</i>, not sticking at Woods or Waters. The next
is, the <i>Black</i>, the black-tann’d, or all Liver-hew’d, or the milk
White Hound, which is the true <i>Talbot</i>, is best for the
<i>String</i>, or <i>Line</i>, as delighting
<span class = "pagenum">7</span>
<span class = "folionum">B4</span>
in Blood; the <i>Largest</i> is the comliest and best. The
<i>Grizled</i>, usually shag-hair’d, are the best Verminers, and so
fittest for the <i>Fox</i>, <i>Badger</i>, or other hot Scents;
a&nbsp;couple of which let not your Kennel be without, as being
exceeding good cunning <i>Finders</i>.</p>

<p>For the <i>Shape</i> of your <i>Hound</i>, you must consult the
Climate of his Breed, and the natural Composition of his Body; but by
these following Characters you may know a good <i>Hound</i>. If you like
a large, <i>heavy</i>, true <i>Talbot-like</i> Hound, See</p>

<p>His <i>Head</i> be round and thick. <i>Nose</i> short and uprising.
<i>Nostrils</i> wide and large. <i>Eares</i> large and down-hanging.
<i>Upper-Lip-Flews</i> lower than his Nether Chaps. <i>Back</i> strong
and rising. <i>Fillets</i> thick and great. <i>Thighs</i> and
<i>Huckle-bones</i> round. <i>Hams</i> streight. <i>Tail</i> long and
rush-grown. The <i>Hair of his Belly</i> hard and stiff. <i>Legs</i> big
and lean. <i>Foot</i> like a <i>Fox</i>’s, well clawd and round.
<i>Sole</i> dry and hard. All these shew an <i>able Hound</i>.</p>

<p>If you would choose a swift <i>light Hound</i>, the <i>Yorkshire</i>
one in the generality will please you; for that (as these have) he ought
to have a <i>slenderer</i>
<span class = "pagenum">8</span>
Head, <i>longer</i> Nose, <i>shallower</i> Ears and Flews, <i>broad</i>
Back, <i>gaunt</i> Belly, <i>small Tayl</i>, <i>long</i> Joints,
<i>round</i> Foot; and in fine of a <i>Gray-Hound-like</i> Make.</p>

<p>Thus much to direct the Choice of <i>Hounds</i>; now something ought
to be spoken of the <i>Composition of Kennels</i>, wherein I must appeal
to the Affection of the Gentleman, the Lover of this Sport, and let him
tell me the <i>Reasons</i> that induced him to take pleasure in
<i>Hounds</i>, Whether it be he fancies <i>Cunning in Hunting</i>? Or
<i>Sweetness</i>, <i>Loudness</i>, or <i>Deepness of Cry</i>? Or for the
<i>Training his Horses</i>? Or for the <i>Exercise of his Body</i>
only?</p>

<p>If for <i>Cunning</i> Hunting; breed your Dogs from the slowest and
largest of the forementioned <i>Northern</i> Hounds, and the swiftest
and slenderest of the <i>West Country</i>, of both Kinds, approved to be
not given to lie off, or look for Advantages, but staunch, fair,
even-running, and of perfect fine Scent. These will make a Horse gallop
fast, and not run; being middle-siz’d; not too swift as to out-run, or
too slow as to lose the Scent; are the best for the true Art and Use of
Hunting.</p>

<p>If for <i>Sweetness of Cry</i>; compound your Kennel of some large
Dogs, of
<span class = "pagenum">9</span>
<span class = "folionum">B5</span>
deep solemn Mouths, and swift in spending, as the <i>Base</i> in the
Consort; Then twice so many roaring, loud ringing Mouths, as the
<i>Counter-Tenor</i>: And lastly, some hollow plain sweet Mouths, as the
<i>Mean</i>: So shall your Cry be perfect. Observe that this Composition
be of the swiftest and largest deep Mouth’d Dog, the slowest and
middle-siz’d, and the shortest Legged slender Dog. For these run even
together; and warble forth their musical Notes most sweetly.</p>

<p>If for <i>Loudness of Mouth</i>, choose the Loud clanging (redoubling
as it were) Mouth, and to this put the roaring, spending, and Whining
Mouth, which will be loud, smart, and pleasant: Such are for the most
part your <i>Shropshire</i>, and <i>Worcestershire</i> Dogs.</p>

<p>If (Lastly) for <i>Deepness of Cry</i>, the largest Dogs having the
greatest Mouths, and deepest Flews, are the best; such are your
<i>West-Country</i>, <i>Cheshire</i>, and <i>Lancashire</i> Dogs.</p>

<p>But if you have your Kennel for <i>Training Horses</i> only; then
compound your Kennel of the lightest, nimblest, and swiftest Dogs, such
as your <i>Northern</i> Hounds are. For the strong and violent Exercises
<span class = "pagenum">10</span>
of their Horses, through the natural Velocity of their Hounds, in the
<i>North</i> parts, have render’d them famous for Truth and Swiftness
above all other parts of <i>England</i>; though they have not attained
this through a better Breeding of their Horses than others, but by daily
acquainting them with the Violence of such Exercises, which made it both
familiar and natural to them. And <i>He that doth not train up his Horse
so, puts a Cheat upon himself</i>.</p>

<p>Lastly, If for the <i>Maintenance of your Health</i>, by preventing
Infirmities and Grossness of Humours, you compose your Kennel; consult
first your own <i>Ability</i> for this Exercise; and if you think you
are able to <i>foot</i> it away, then the <i>Biggest and slowest
Dogs</i> you can get are best; which you may bring so to your Command,
as to make them Hunt with no more speed than you please to lead them.
And herein you are surrounded with a double Delight; to hear their
<i>Musick</i>, and observe their ambitious and eager <i>Striving to
out-go one another</i>, in the Pursuit of their Game, and yet restrained
by a submissive Compliance to their Masters Pleasure, beyond which
<span class = "pagenum">11</span>
they dare not presume to pass. But if you would <i>pad it</i> away
through an Unability of footing it, Then choose the <i>slowest or
middle-sized Hounds</i>, of good Mouths and Noses, for loud Cry, and
ready Scent.</p>

<p>Thus far for the Composing a Kennel: I come now to the <i>Kennel it
self</i>, of which I need say little, as indeed unnecessary, leaving
that to the Discretion of the <i>Huntsman</i>; Only I would have him
observe, that it be built some pretty way distant from the
Dwelling-House, in a warm dry place, free from Vermine, and near some
Pond or River of fresh Water; and so placed, that the Morning Sun may
shine upon it. Be sure to keep it clean, and let them not want fresh
Straw every day. Feed them early in the Morning at Sun-rising, and at
Sun-set in the Evening. As for their <i>Meat</i>, I&nbsp;leave to the
ingenious Huntsman to get; Only this I must tell him, Three Bushels of
Oates or Barley-Meal, with the half so much Bran or Mill-dust, besides
the Horse-Flesh, Scraps, Bones, Crusts, &amp;c. which the painful
Huntsman can procure, is a fit weekly Proportion to keep <i>nine</i> or
<i>ten</i> Couple of Hounds. When they
<span class = "pagenum">12</span>
come from Hunting, after you have fed them well, let them to their
Kennel, and wash their Feet with Beer and Butter, or some such thing,
and pick and search their Cleys, for Thorns, Stubs, or the like: If it
is in <i>Winter</i>, let a fire be made, and let them beak and stretch
themselves for an hour or so at the fire, and suffer them to lick, pick,
and trim themselves; hereby to prevent the <i>Diseases</i> incident to
them, upon sudden Cooling, as the <i>Mange</i>, <i>Itch</i>,
<i>Feavors</i>, &amp;c. of which I come now to speak.</p>

<!-- missing letters stuck to following page -->

<p>But before I treat of the keeping your Hounds in Health by curing
their diseases, I&nbsp;must speak a Word or two of the way to <i>Breed
good Whelps</i>, viz. Having a Hound and a Bratch of that general
Goodness in Size, Voice, Speed, Scent, and Proportion you like, put them
together to <ins class = "correction" title = "second ‘n’ invisible">ingender</ins> in <i>January</i>, <i>February</i>, or
<i>March</i>, as <span class = "missing">the</span> properest Months for
Hounds, Bitches, and Bratches to be Limed in; because of not <i>losing
time</i> to enter them. When you put them together, observe, as near as
you can, if the <i>Moon</i> be in <i>Aquarius</i> or <i>Gemini</i>;
because the Whelps will then never run Mad, and the Litter, will be
<span class = "pagenum">13</span>
double as many Dog, as Bitch, Whelps. When your Bitch is near her
<i>Whelping</i>, separate her from the other Hounds, and make her a
Kennel particularly by her self; and see her Kennell’d every Night, that
she might be acquainted and delighted with it, and so not seek out
unwholsom Places; for if you remove the Whelps after they are Whelp’d,
the Bitch will carry them up and down till she come to their first Place
of Littering; and that’s very dangerous. Suffer not your Whelps to Suck
above two Months, and then <i>Weane</i> them.</p>

<p>When your Whelps are brought up, <i>enter</i> them not into Hunting
till they are at least a Year and half old: That is, if whelpt in
<i>March</i>, enter them <i>September</i> come Twelve-Month; if in
<i>April</i>, in <i>October</i> come Twelve-months after,
<i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<p>When you would <i>enter</i> them, bring them abroad, with the most
Staunch and best Hunting Hounds; (all babling and flying Curs being left
at home:) and a <i>Hare being the best entering Chase</i>, get your
<i>Hare</i> ready before, and putting her from her Form, view which way
she takes, and then lay on your
<span class = "pagenum">14</span>
Hounds, giving them all the Advantages may be; if she is caught, do not
suffer them to break her, but immediately taking her, strip off her
Skin, and cutting her to peices, give every part to your young Whelps;
and that will beget in them a Delight in Hunting, and animate them with
Courage. And now let us return to speak of</p>


<h5 class = "ital">Diseases incident to Dogs, and their Cures.</h5>

<p>Because I should think it a very odd Humor for a Person to select
these Creatures (Hounds) as instruments for the procurement of his
Health Satisfaction, and Delight, and should be so inhumane as to suffer
them to perish in their <i>Diseases</i>, because they cannot communicate
their <i>Ailings</i>, and beseech <i>Redress</i>; therefore I have
briefly summed up the immediate <i>Cures</i> for their several Diseases,
and by preventing his Excuse of <i>Ignorance</i>, desire his
Application, as need require.</p>

<p><i>For Sick Dogs.</i> Take Sheeps-heads, Wooll and all, hack, hew,
and bruise them into pieces, make Pottage of it, with Oatmeal, and
<i>Penny-Royal</i>, and give it warm.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">15</span>
<p><i>Lice and Fleas.</i> Boyl four or five handfuls of <i>Rue</i> or
<i>Herb of Grace</i>, in a gallon of running Water, till a pottle be
consumed, strain it, and put two Ounces of <i>Staves-acre</i> poudered,
and bathe them with it warm.</p>

<p><i>Itch.</i> Take Oyl of <i>Flower-de-Lys</i>, powder of
<i>Brimstone</i>, &amp; dry’d <i>Elicampane</i> Roots, of each a like
quantity, and <i>Bay-Salt</i> powdered; mix these Powders with the Oyl,
and warm it, anoint, scratch, and make it bleed, will do well.</p>

<p><i>Tetter.</i> Take Black <i>Ink</i>, Juice of <i>Mint</i> &amp;
<i>Vinegar</i>, of each a like, mix them altogether with the Powder of
<i>Brimstone</i> to a Salve, and Anoint&nbsp;it.</p>

<p><i>Worms.</i> Give your Hound <i>Brimstone</i> and new Milk, will
kill them.</p>

<p><i>Gauling.</i> May <i>Butter</i>, yellow <i>Wax</i>, and unslackt
<i>Lime</i>, made to a Salve, and Anoint therewith, is a present
Remedy.</p>

<p><i>Mange.</i> Take two handfuls of <i>Wild-Cresses</i>, of
<i>Elecampane</i>, of the Leaves and Roots of <i>Roerb</i> and
<i>Sorrel</i>, the like quantity, and two pound of the Roots of
<i>Frodels</i>, Boyl them all well in Lye and Vinegar, strain it, and
put therein two pound of <i>Grey soap</i>, and after ’tis melted, rub
your Hound with it four or five dayes together; and ’tis an excellent
Remedy.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">16</span>
<p><i>For any Ear Disease.</i> Mix <i>Verjuice</i> and <i>Chervile</i>
Water together, and drop into his Eares a spoonful or two, morning and
Evening.</p>

<p><i>Sore Eyes.</i> Chew a Leaf or two of <i>Ground Ivy</i>, and spit
the Juice into his Eyes.</p>

<p><i>Surbaiting.</i> Wash his Feet with <i>Beer</i> and <i>Butter</i>,
and bind young red <i>Nettles</i> beaten to a Salve to his Soles.</p>

<p><i>Biting by Snake, Adder,</i> &amp;c. Beat the herb <i>Calaminth</i>
with <i>Turpentine</i>, and yellow <i>Wax</i> to a Salve, and apply it.
To expel the inward Poyson, give the said Herb in Milk.</p>

<p><i>Biting by a Mad Dog.</i> Wash the place with <i>Sea-Water</i>, or
strong <i>Brine</i>, will Cure him. The quantity of a Hazel-Nut of
<i>Mithridate</i>, dissolved in sweet Wine, will prevent inward
Infection.</p>

<p><i>Madness<ins class = "correction" title = ". invisible">.</ins></i>
Lastly, If your Hound be Mad, which you will soon find by his separating
himself from the rest, throwing his Head into the Wind, foaming and
slavering at Mouth, snatching at every thing he meets, red fiery Eyes,
stinking filthy Breath; then to Knock him in the Head, is a present
Remedy, and you’l prevent infinite Dangers.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">17</span>
<p>And now I proceed to give some brief Instructions for Hunting the
several <i>Chases</i> used in <i>England</i>, for which we have chosen
our Hounds; I&nbsp;mean the <i>Time when?</i> and the <i>Manner
how?</i></p>

<p>Having your Kennel of Hounds in good order and plight, and being
desirous to enjoy those Pleasures, for which we have observed the
aforesaid Rules; Lead them forth, and to your Game (Gentlemen:) Only
take this <i>Caution</i> along with you; Do not forget to have in your
Pack a couple of <i>Hounds</i>, called <i>Hunters in the Highwayes</i>,
that will Scent upon hard Ground, where we cannot perceive Pricks or
Impressions; and for your Huntsman’s and your own Ease, let a couple of
<i>Old stench Hounds</i> accompany you, by whose sure Scent, the too
great Swiftness of the young and unexperienced Ones may be restrained
and regulated; and if you please, take the following Observations with
you, and away.</p>


<h5>Of <i>Hart</i> or <i>Stag-Hunting</i>.</h5>

<p>Waving the Praises of this Creature, and the large <i>Encomiums</i>
due to his several Excellencies, we’ll come to
<span class = "pagenum">18</span>
the Doctrinal Part, and understand the <i>Age</i> of this our Game,
which is known by several Marks, amongst which this is the most
authentick: That if you take his view in the ground, and perceive he has
a large Foot, a&nbsp;thick Heel, a&nbsp;deep Print, open Cleft and long
space, then be assured he is Old; as the Contrary concludes him
Young.</p>

<p>But <i>Where</i> and <i>When</i> shall we find him? Examine the
following Annual or monethly Season-Description, and you shall find him;
begining at the end of Rutting-time, that is, In</p>

<p><i>November</i>, in Heaths among Furs, Shrubs and Whines.</p>

<p><i>December</i>, in Forrests among thick and strong Woods.</p>

<p><i>January</i>, in Corners of the Forrests, Corn-fields,
<i>Wheat</i>, <i>Rye</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p><i>February</i> and <i>March</i>, Amongst young and thick Bushes.</p>

<p><i>April</i> and <i>May</i>, in Coppices and Springs.</p>

<p><i>June</i> and <i>July</i>, in Out-Woods and Purlieus nearest the
Corn Fields.</p>

<p><i>September</i> and <i>October</i>, After the first showers of Rain,
they leave their Thickets, and go to Rut, during which
<span class = "pagenum">19</span>
time there is no certain place to find them&nbsp;in.</p>

<p>When you have found him in any of these places, be careful to go up
the Wind; and the best time to find him is <i>before Sun-rising</i>,
when he goes to feed; then watch him to his Leir, and having lodged him,
go and prepare; if he is not forced, he will not budge till Evening.
Approaching his Lodging, cast off your <i>Finders</i>, who having Hunted
him a Ring or two, cast in the rest; and being in full Cry and maine
Chace, Comfort and Cheer them with Horne and Voice. Be sure to take
notice of him by some <i>Mark</i>, and if your Dogs make <i>Default</i>,
rate them off and bring them to the Default back, and make them cast
about till they have undertaken the first Deer; Then cheer them to the
utmost, and so continue till they have either set up or slain him. It is
the Nature of a <i>Stag</i>, to seek for one of his kind, when he is
Imbost or weary, and beating him up, ly down in his place; therefore
have a watchful eye unto <i>Change</i>. As likewise by taking
<i>Soil</i> (<i>i. e.</i> Water) he will swim a River just in the middle
down the Stream, covering himself
<span class = "pagenum">20</span>
all over, but his Nose, keeping the middle, least by touching any
Boughe<span class = "missing">s</span> he leave a Scent for the Hounds;
And <span class = "missing">by</span> his Crossings and Doublings he
will e<span class = "missing">n</span>deavour to baffle his Pursuers: In
th<span class = "missing">ese</span> Cases have regard to your <i>Old
Hou<span class = "missing">nds,</span></i> as I said before. When he is
<i>Imbost</i> <span class = "missing">or</span> weary, may be known
thus: By <span class = "missing">his </span> Creeping into holes, and
often lying down, or by his running stiff, high and lumpering, slavering
and foaming at Mouth, shining and blackness of his Hair, and much Sweat;
And thus much for <i>Stag</i> or <i>Hart Hunting</i>. As for the
<i>Buck</i> I shall not speak any thing, for he that can Hunt a
<i>Stag</i> well, cannot fail Hunting a <i>Buck</i> well. As likewise
for the <i>Roe-Hunting</i>, I&nbsp;refer you to what is spoken of the
<i>Hart</i> or <i>Stag</i>.</p>

<!-- missing words supplied from 1696 if matching -->


<h5 class = "ital">Of Hare Hunting.</h5>

<p>As for the <i>Time</i>, the most proper to begin this Game, note;
That about the middle of <i>September</i> is best and to end towards the
latter end of <i>February</i>, when surcease, and destroy not the young
early Brood of <i>Leverets</i>; and this season is most agreeable
likewise to the nature of <i>Hounds</i>; moist and cool.
<span class = "pagenum">21</span>
Now for the <i>Place</i> where to find her, <span class =
"missing">you</span> must examine and observe the Sea<span class =
"missing">sons</span> of the Year; for in Summer or <span class =
"missing">Spring</span> time, you shall find them in <span class =
"missing">Corn-</span>fields and open places, not sitting <span class =
"missing">in Bushes</span>, for fear of Snakes, Adders, <span class =
"missing"><i>&amp;c.</i></span> In <i>Winter</i> they love Tuffs of
<span class = "missing">Thorns</span> and Brambles, near Houses: <span
class = "missing">In</span> these places you must regard the
<i>Oldness</i> or <i>Newness</i> of her <i>Forme</i> or Seat, to prevent
Labour in Vain: If it be plain and smooth within, and the Pad before it
flat and worn, and the Prickles so new and perceptible, that the Earth
seems black, and fresh broken, then assure your self the Forme is new,
and from thence you may Hunt and recover the <i>Hare</i>; if the
contrary (which narrowly observe) it is Old, and if your <i>Hounds</i>
call upon it, rate them off; the Scent is Old. When the <i>Hare</i> is
started and on Foot, step in where you saw her pass, and hollow in your
<i>Hounds</i> till they have undertaken it, then go on with full Cry.
Above all be sure to observe her first Doubling, which must be your
direction for all that day; for all her other after Doublings will be
like that. When she is thus reduced to the <i>slights</i> and
<i>shifts</i>
<span class = "pagenum">22</span>
she makes by Doublings and Windings, give your Dogs <i>Time</i> and
<i>Place</i> enough to cast about your Rings, for unwinding the same;
and observe her <i>leaps</i> and <i>skips</i> before she squat, and beat
curiously all likely places of Harbour: She is soon your Prey now.</p>


<h5 class = "ital">Of Coney-Catching.</h5>

<p>Their <i>Seasons</i> are alwayes, and the way of taking them thus:
Set Pursenets on their Holes, and put in a <i>Ferret</i> close muzzled,
and she will bolt them out (being a natural Enemy to them) into the
Nets: Or blow on the suddain the Drone of a Bag-Pipe into the Burrows,
and they will boult out: Or for want of either of these two, take powder
of <i>Orpine</i> and <i>Brimstone</i> and boult them out with the
Smother: But pray use this last seldom, unless you would destroy your
Warren. But for this sport <i>Hays</i> are to be preferred above
all.</p>


<h5 class = "ital">Of Fox Hunting.</h5>

<p><i>January</i>, <i>February</i>, and <i>March</i>, are the best
Seasons for Hunting the <i>Fox</i> above ground, the scent being then
strong,
<span class = "pagenum">23</span>
and the coldest Weather for the <i>Hounds</i>, and best finding his
Earthing. Cast off your sure Finders first, and as the <i>Drag</i>
mends, more; but not too many at once, because of the Variety of Chaces
in Woods and Coverts. The night before the day of Hunting, when the
<i>Fox</i> goes to prey at midnight, find his Earths, and stop them with
Black Thorns and Earth. To find him draw your <i>Hounds</i> about
Groves, Thickets, and Bushes near Villages; Pigs and Poultrey inviting
him to such Places to Lurk in. They make their Earths in hard Clay,
stony ground, and amongst Roots of Trees; and have but one Hole straight
and long. He is usually taken, with <i>Hounds</i>, <i>Grey-Hounds</i>,
<i>Terriers</i>, <i>Nets</i> and <i>Gins</i>.</p>


<h5 class = "ital">Of Badger-Hunting.</h5>

<p>This Creature has several Names, as <i>Gray</i>, <i>Brock</i>,
<i>Boreson</i>, or <i>Bauson</i>; and is hunted thus. First go seek the
Earths and Burrows where he lieth, and in a clear Moon-shine Night, stop
all the Holes but one or two, and in these fasten Sacks with drawing
strings; and being thus set, cast off your <i>Hounds</i>
<span class = "pagenum">24</span>
and beat all the Groves, Hedges, and Tuffs within a mile or two about,
and being alarum’d by the Doggs they will repair to their Burrows and
Kennells, and running into the Bags are taken. Other Methods there are
which are used, but the Common usage makes me omit.</p>


<h5 class = "ital">Of the Martern or wild-Cat.</h5>

<p>These two Chaces are usually hunted in <i>England</i>, and are as
great Infesters of Warrens, as the two last mentioned Vermine, but are
not purposely to be sought after; unless the Huntsman see their place of
Prey, and can go to it; and if the <i>Hound</i> chance to cross them,
sport may be had. But no Rule can be prescribed how to find or hunt
them.</p>


<h5 class = "ital">Of the Otter.</h5>

<p>This Creature useth to lye near Rivers in his Lodging, which he
cunningly &amp; artificially builds with Boughs, Twiggs and Sticks.
A&nbsp;great Devourer of Fish, and eatable in some Countries, where they
have <i>good stomacks</i>. It is a very sagacious and exquisitely
smelling Creature, and much Cunning and Craft
<span class = "pagenum">25</span>
<span class = "folionum">C</span>
is required to hunt him. But to take him, observe this in short: Being
provided with <i>Otter-Spears</i> to watch his Vents, and good
<i>Otter-Hounds</i>, beat both sides of the Rivers banks, and you’ll
soon find if there is any. If you find him, and perceive where he swims
under Water, get to stand before him when he <i>Vents</i>, (<i>i. e.</i>
takes breath) and endeavour to strike him with the spear: If you miss
him, follow him with your Hound, and if they are good for <i>Otter</i>,
they will certainly beat every Tree-root, <i>Bulrush-Bed</i>, or
<i>Osier-Bed</i>, so that he cannot escape you.</p>


<h5 class = "ital">Of the Wild Goat.</h5>

<p>This being a <i>Welsh-Chace</i>, I thought it not amiss to say
something of it, as not altogether Forreign. The <i>Wild-Goat</i> is as
bigg and as fleshy as a <i>Hart</i>, but not so long-legg’d. The best
time for hunting them is, at <i>All-hollontide</i>; and having observed
the Advantages of the Coasts, Rocks, and places where the <i>Goats</i>
lie, set Nets and Toiles towards the Rivers and Bottoms; for ’tis not to
be imagined, the Doggs can follow them down every place of the
Mountaines.
<span class = "pagenum">26</span>
Stand some on the tops of the Rocks, and as Occasion offers throw down
Stones; and place your Relays at the small Brooks or Waters, where the
<i>Goat</i> comes down; but let them not tarry till the <i>Hounds</i>
come in, that were cast off.</p>

<p class = "space">

<p><span class = "firstletter">A</span>s all <i>Beasts</i> are
Subservient to <i>Man</i>, and he a Liberty and Power to Use them, and
make them his Instruments, for the Procurement of his <i>Profit</i>, or
<i>Pleasure</i>; so is there not a Creature more Serviceable to man in
either of these, as the <i>Horse</i>. A&nbsp;<i>Beast</i> Valiant,
Strong, Nimble and Hardy, the Vivacity of whose Spirits, neither Heat
can scorch, or dry up, nor Cold benumb or freez; he is Valiant,
Watchfull, and Laborious, naturally Cleanly, and of exquisite Scent;
Gentle and Loving to man, docile, and of a retentive Memory, and Apt or
Fit for the performing any Service wherein man
<span class = "pagenum">27</span>
<span class = "folionum">C2</span>
employes him. And for the Use of which I am now speaking (<i>Racing</i>)
he ought to be endued with these Qualifications. That he have the
<i>Finest Cleanest Shape</i> possible, and above all, <i>Nimble</i>,
<i>Quick</i>, and <i>Fiery</i>, <i>apt to Fly with the least Motion</i>;
nor is a long Bodied contemptible, it assuring <i>Speed</i>, tho it
signifies <i>Weakness</i> too. The <i>Arabian</i>, <i>Barbary</i>, or
his Bastard, are esteemed the best for this Use, these excelling
<i>Jennets</i>, though they are good too.</p>

<p>Having furnished your self with a <i>Horse</i> thus qualified, you
are to observe his right and due <i>Ordering</i>, before your designed
<i>Racing</i>. <i>Bartholomew-tide</i> is the most proper time to
<i>take him from Grass</i>; the day before being Dry, Fair, and
Pleasant: That Night let him stand conveniently, to empty his Body; the
next day <i>Stable</i> him, and feed him with <i>Wheat-straw</i> that
day, and no longer; lest you exceeding that time, it straighten his
<i>Guts</i>, heat his <i>Liver</i>, and hurt his <i>Blood</i>; for want
of <i>Straw</i>, Riding him Morning and Evening to <i>Water</i>, Airing,
or other moderate Exercises will serve. Then feed him with good old
sweet <i>Hay</i>, and according to the Season, and Temperature of his
Body
<span class = "pagenum">28</span>
clothe him; for a <i>Smooth Coat</i> shews <i>Cloth</i> enough, and a
<i>Rough Coat</i> want of it. Observe likewise where you <i>Water</i>
your <i>Race-Horse</i>, that it be a Running <i>Water</i>, or Clear
<i>Spring</i>, far distant (a&nbsp;Mile or more) from the <i>Stable</i>,
adjoyning to some <i>Levell</i>; where after he has once well drunk,
Gallop him, and so <i>Water</i> and <i>Scope</i> him, till that he
refuse to drink more, for that time; then Walk him gently Home, (being
an Hour on your way, or more) clothe, and stop him round with soft
<i>Whisps</i>, and let him stand an Hour upon his <i>Bridle</i>, and
after feed him with sweet sound <i>Oats</i>, throughly dryed either with
<i>Age</i>, <i>Kilne</i>, or <i>Sun</i>; if he be low of Flesh, or bad
Stomacht, add a third part of Clean Old <i>Beans</i>, to two parts of
<i>Oats</i>, or wash his <i>Oats</i> in Strong <i>Beer</i> or
<i>Ale</i>.</p>

<p>For <i>Dressing</i> take these <i>Rules</i>. <i>Dress</i> your
<i>Horse</i> twice a day, before you <i>Water</i> him, both Morning, and
Evening, thus: <i>Curry</i> him after he is uncloath’d, from his
<i>Ear-tips</i> to his <i>Tayle</i>, and his whole Body intirely (save
his Legs under the Knees, and Cambrels) with an <i>Iron Comb</i>; then
Dust him, and Rub him with a <i>Brush</i> of <i>Bristles</i> over
again<ins class = "correction" title = ". invisible">.</ins>
<span class = "pagenum">29</span>
<span class = "folionum">C3</span>
Dust him again, and wetting your hand in clean Water, rub off all the
loose Hairs, and so rub him dry as at first; then with a fine <i>Hair
Cloth</i> rub him all over; and Lastly, with a fine <i>Linnen Cloth</i>;
and then pick his <i>Eyes</i>, <i>Nostrils</i>, <i>Sheath</i>,
<i>Cods</i>, <i>Tuel</i>, and <i>Feet</i>, clean.</p>

<p>The best <i>Food</i> for your <i>Racer</i>, is good, sweet, well
dryed, sunned, and beaten <i>Oats</i>: Or else <i>Bread</i> made of one
part <i>Beans</i>, and two parts <i>Wheat</i> (<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>) two
<i>Bushells</i> of <i>Wheat</i>, to one of <i>Beans</i>, ground
together: Boult through a fine <i>Range</i> half a <i>Bushell</i> of
fine <i>Meal</i>, and bake that in two or three <i>Loaves</i> by it
self, and with <i>Water</i>, and good store of <i>Barme</i>, knead up,
and bake the rest in great <i>Loaves</i>, having sifted it through a
<i>Meal-sieve</i>: [But to your <i>Finer</i>, you would do well to put
the <i>Whites</i> of Twenty or Thirty <i>Eggs</i>, and with the
<i>Barme</i> a little <i>Ale</i>, ’tis no matter how little
<i>Water</i>:] With the <i>Courser</i> feed him on his Resting dayes, on
his Labouring dayes with the <i>Finer</i>.</p>

<p>The best <i>Time for feeding</i> your <i>Runner</i> on his
<i>Resting-dayes</i> is; After his <i>Watering</i> in the Morning, at
<i>One</i> a Clock at Noon, after his <i>VVatering</i> in the
<span class = "pagenum">30</span>
Evening, and at <i>Nine</i> or <i>Ten</i> a Clock at Nights: On his
<i>Dayes of Labour</i>, Two Hours after he is throughly Cold, outwardly
and inwardly, as before.</p>

<p>As for the Proportion of Meat, I shall not confine your Love to a
Quantity, only give him a little at once, as long as his Appetite is
Good: When he begins to fumble and play with his Meat, hold your Hand,
shut up your Sack.</p>

<p>As for his <i>Exercise</i> it ought to be Thrice a Week, as his
bodily Condition requires; if he be foul, moderate Exercise will break
his Grease; if clean, then as you judge best, taking heed of breaking
his Mettle, or discouraging him, or laming his Limbs. Before you air him
to add to his Wind, it is requisite to give him a raw Egg broken in his
mouth: If your Horse be very <i>Fat</i>, air him before Sun-rising and
after Sun-set; if <i>Lean</i>, deprive him not of the least strength and
Comfort of the <i>Sun</i> you can devise. To make him <i>Sweat</i>
sometimes by coursing him in his Cloathes is necessary, if moderate; but
without his Cloaths, let it be sharp and swift. See that he be <i>empty
before you Course him</i>; and it is wholesome to wash his Tongue and
<span class = "pagenum">31</span>
<span class = "folionum">C4</span>
Nostrills with <i>Vinegar</i>, or <i>piss</i> in his Mouth, before you
back him. And after his Exercise, cool him before you come home, house,
litter and rub him well and dry; then cloath him, and give him after
every Course a Scouring thus prepared.</p>


<h5 class = "ital">For scouring a Race Horse.</h5>

<p>Take 20 <i>Raisins of the Sun</i> stoned, 10. <i>Figgs</i> slit in
the midst, boyle them till they be thick in a Pottle of Fair Water, mix
it with Powder of <i>Annis-Seeds</i>, <i>Lycoras</i>, and
<i>Sugar-candy</i>, till it come to a stiff Paste, make them into round
Balls, roul them in Butter, and give him three or four of them the next
morning after his Course, and ride him an hour after, and then set him
up Warm. Or this may be preferred, being both a Purge and a Restorative,
a&nbsp;Cleanser and a Comforter, thus prepared.</p>

<p>Take three Ounces of <i>Annis-Seeds</i>, six Drams of
<i>Cummin-Seeds</i>, one Dram and half of <i>Carthamus</i>, one Ounce
and two Drams of <i>Fennugreek-Seed</i>, one Ounce and half of
<i>Brimstone</i>; Beat all these to a fine Powder, and searse them;
<span class = "pagenum">32</span>
then take a Pint and two Ounces of <i>Sallet Oyl</i>, a&nbsp;pint and
half of <i>Honey</i>, and a Pottle of <i>White-wine</i>; then with a
sufficient Quantity of fine white Meal, knead and work all well into a
stiff Paste; keep it in a clean Cloath, for use. When occasion requires,
dissolve a Ball of it in a Pail of Water, and after Exercise give it him
to drink in the Dark, that he may not see the Colour, and refuse it: If
he does refuse, let Fasting force him to be of another mind.</p>

<p>To conclude, those Instructions, which are enumerated by Mr.
<i>Markham</i>, I&nbsp;will give you in short before you run, and then
away as fast as you can.</p>

<p><i>Course not your Horse hard four or five dayes before your Match,
lest you make his Limbs sore, and abate his Speed.</i></p>

<p><i>Muzzle him not (except a foul Feeder) above two or three Nights
before the Race, and the Night before his bloody Courses.</i></p>

<p><i>Give him sharp, <ins class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘as / as’">as</ins>
well as gentle, Courses on the Race he is to run.</i></p>

<p><i>Shoe him a day before you run him.</i></p>

<p><i>Let him be empty on the Match Day.</i></p>

<p><i>Saddle him in the Stable, and fix to him the Girths and Pannel
with Shoo-makers Wax.</i></p>

<span class = "pagenum">33</span>
<p><i>Lead him with all Gentleness to his Course, and let him smell
other Horses Dung to provoke him to stale</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>And Lastly, Being come to the starting place rub him well, uncloath
him, then take his Back, and the Word given, with all Gentleness and
Quietness possible, start and away; <i>And God speed you well</i>.</p>

with what is meerly necessary for the right <i>Understanding and Use</i>
of this Noble Art. I&nbsp;shall begin then with <i>Hawks</i>, their
<i>Names</i> and <i>Flights</i>.</p>


<h5 class = "ital">Of Hawks there are two sorts.</h5>

<p>The Long-Winged Hawks.</p>

as</p>

<p>The Second Year an <i>Intermewer</i>.</p>
<p>The Third Year a <i>White Hawk</i>.</p>
<p>The Fourth Year a <i>Hawk of the First Coat</i>.</p>
</div>

<p>Thus much for their <i>Names</i>, now we come to speak of the
<i>Flights</i> of these <i>Hawks</i>; which are these</p>

<div class = "hanging">
<p>The <i>Faulcon-Gentle</i>, for <i>Partridge</i> or
<i>Mallard</i>.</p>
<p><i>Gerfaulcon</i>, will fly at the <i>Herne</i>.</p>
<p><i>Saker</i>, at the <i>Crane</i> or <i>Bittern</i>.</p>

<p><i>Barbary-Faulcon</i>, at the <i>Partridge</i> only.</p>
<p><i>Merlin</i> and <i>Hobby</i>, at the <i>Lark</i>, or any small

<p><i>Goshawk</i> and <i>Tiercel</i>, at the <i>Partridge</i>, or
<i>Hare</i>.</p>
<p><i>Sparrow-Hawk</i>, at the <i>Partridge</i> or <i>Black-Bird</i>.
And the</p>
<p><i>Musket</i>, at the <i>Bush</i>.</p>
</div>

<p>Thus much for their several proper <i>Flights</i>, we are now come to
their <i>Manning</i>, the Method of which being generally one and the
same (though it has been the Labour of some to spend much Time, and many
Words in treating of the various wayes of <i>Manning Hawks</i>, and yet
comes all to one effect) I&nbsp;shall in short (according to the Design
of this <i>Epitome</i>) lay down this Rule: That you watch, and keep
them from Sleep, continually carrying them upon your <i>Fist</i>,
familiarly stroak them with a Wing of some Dead <i>Fowle</i>, or the
like, and play with them; Accustome to gaze, and look in their Face with
a Loving, Smiling, Gentle Countenance; and that will make her
acquainted, and familiar with Man.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">36</span>
<p>Having made them familiar, the next thing is to <i>Bring them to the
Lure</i>, (which the <i>Faulconer</i> makes of <i>Feathers</i>, and
<i>Leather</i> much like a <i>Fowle</i>, which he casts into the Air,
and calls the <i>Hawk</i> to) which is after this manner. Set your
<i>Hawk</i> on the <i>Perch</i>, unhood her, and shew her some
<i>Meat</i> within your <i>Fist</i>, call her by <i>Chirping</i>,
<i>Whistling</i> or the like, till she comes, then Feed her with it; if
she comes not, let her Fast, and be sharp set: <i>Short-winged
Hawks</i>, are properly said to be <i>Called</i>, not <i>Lured</i>. Make
her bold, and acquainted with <i>Men</i>, <i>Dogs</i>, and
<i>Horses</i>, and let her be eager and sharp-set, before you shew her
the <i>Lure</i>; knowing her <i>Luring</i> Hours; and let both sides of
the <i>Lure</i> be garnished with warm, and bloody <i>Meat</i>; let her
likewise know your <i>Voice</i> well; so that being well acquainted with
<i>Voice</i>, and <i>Lure</i>, the Hearing of the one, or Sight of the
other, makes her Obedient; which you must reward by <i>Feeding</i>, or
punish by <i>Fasting</i>. But before <i>Luring</i> (or any
<i>Flight</i>) it is requisite to <i>Bathe</i> your <i>Hawk</i> in some
quiet and still shallow <i>Brook</i>, or for want of that in a Large
<i>Bason</i>, shallow <i>Tub</i>, or the like, lest being at
<span class = "pagenum">37</span>
Liberty, you lose your <i>Hawk</i>, (whose Nature requires such Bathing)
and make her rangle. Now to make her know her <i>Lure</i>, is thus: Give
your <i>Hawk</i> to another, and having loosned in readiness her
Hood-strings, and fastened a <i>Pullet</i> to the <i>Lure</i>, go a
little distance, cast it half the length of the string about your Head,
still <i>Luring</i> with your Voice, unhood your <i>Hawk</i>, and throw
it a little way from her: If she stoop and seize, let her plume the
<i>Pullet</i>, and feed on it upon the <i>Lure</i>: Then take her and
Meat on your Fist, Hood her, and give her the Tiring of the Wing, or
Foot of the said <i>Pullet</i>.</p>

<p>Having <i>Manned</i> and <i>Lured</i> your <i>Hawk</i>, before you
bring her to her <i>Flight</i>, one thing is to be observed and done,
called in the <i>Faulconers Dialect</i>, <i>Enseaming</i>, which is to
cleanse her from <i>Fat</i>, <i>Grease</i>, &amp; <i>Glut</i>, known by
her round <i>Thighs</i>, and full <i>Meutings</i>; and thus you may do
it: In the Morning when you feed her, give her a bit or two of
<i>Hot-meat</i>, and at Night very little or nothing. Then feed her
Morning and Evening with a <i>Rook</i>, wash’d twice till the Pinions be
tender; then give a Casting of Feathers as her Nature will bear; and
once in
<span class = "pagenum">38</span>
two or three dayes give her a <i>Hens-neck</i> well joynted and washt:
Then a quick train <i>Pigeon</i> every Morning; and after by these and
her own Exercise, she has broken and dissolved the <i>Grease</i>, give
her three or Four <i>Pellets</i> of the Root of <i>Sellandine</i>, as
bigg as a <i>Garden Pease</i>, steept in the Sirrup of <i>Roses</i>; and
you have done this part of your Duty.</p>

<p>To <i>Enter</i> your <i>Hawks</i>, for <i>Partridge</i> or
<i>Fowle</i>, observe this. Lay an Old Feild-<i>Partridge</i> in a Hole,
covered with something, and fasten to it a small <i>Creance</i> (<i>i.
e.</i> a Fine small long Line of strong and even-wound Packthread
fastned to the <i>Hawks</i> Leash when first Lured,) and uncoupling your
ranging <i>Spaniels</i>, pluck off the Covering of the Traine
<i>Partridge</i> and let it go, and the <i>Hawk</i> after it; and as
soon as she has slain it, reward her well with it. And thus to make her
fly at <i>Fowle</i>, feed her well with the <i>Traine</i> of the Fowle
you would have; doing afterwards as above.</p>

<p>The <i>Faults</i> of <i>Hawks</i> differ according to their Nature
and Make: <i>Long-winged Hawks</i> faults are thus helped. If she used
<i>to take stand</i>, flying at the River, or
<span class = "pagenum">39</span>
in Champain Feilds, shun flying near Trees or Covert; or otherwise, let
several Persons have <i>Trains</i>, and as she offers to stand, let him
that’s next her cast out his Traine, and she killing it reward her. And
indeed you ought never to be without some live Bird or Fowle in your
Bag, as <i>Pigeon</i>, <i>Duck</i>, <i>Mallard</i>, &amp;c. If she be
<i>Froward</i> and <i>Coy</i>; when she Kills, reward her not as
usually, but slide some other meat under her, and let her take her
pleasure on it; giving her some Feathers to make her scoure and cast. If
she be <i>Wild</i>, <i>look not inward</i>, but mind <i>Check</i>,
(<i>i. e.</i> other Game, as <i>Crows</i>, &amp;c. that fly cross her)
then lure her back, and stooping to it, reward her presently.</p>

<p>The faults of <i>Short-Winged Hawks</i> thus are helped. Sometimes
the <i>Goshawk</i> and <i>Sparrow-Hawks</i>, will neither kill, nor
<i>Fly</i> the Game to <i>Mark</i>, but will turn <i>Taile</i> to it:
Then encourage your Dogs to Hunt, cast a Traine <i>Partridge</i> before
your <i>Hawk</i>, make her seize it, and feed well upon&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>If a <i>Hawk take a Tree</i>, and will not fly at all, feed her then
upon quick Birds, and make her foot them, and in the plain Champaign
Feilds unhood
<span class = "pagenum">40</span>
her, and riding up and down a while let one cast out a
Feild-<i>Partridge</i> before her, let her fly at it, and footing it
feed on it. If they be <i>too fond of Man</i>, that after a stroke or
two will not fly, be seldom familiar with her, and reward her not as she
comes so improperly: Otherwise reward her well.</p>

<p>As for <i>Mewing of Hawks</i>, the best time for <i>Long-winged
Hawks</i> is about the middle of <i>April</i>, and <i>March</i> for the
<i>Short-Winged Hawks</i>. There are two kinds of Mewings. 1.&nbsp;<i>At
the stock or stone</i>; so called from its being low upon the ground,
free from Noise, Vermin or ill Air. 2.&nbsp;<i>At large</i>; so called
from being in a high Room, with open Windows towards the <i>North</i> or
<i>North-East</i>. The former is accounted the best Mewing. I&nbsp;shall
not insist on the erecting or ordering of this Mew, leaving that to the
Discretion of the Faulconer; only before he mews his <i>Hawk</i>, see if
they have <i>Lice</i>, to pepper and scowre them too. The best <i>time
to draw</i> the Field-<i>Hawk</i> <i>from the Mew</i>, is in
<i>June</i>, and she will be ready to fly in <i>August</i>; the Hawks
for the River in <i>August</i>, will be ready in <i>September</i>. And
because <i>Hawks</i> are subject to divers Infirmities and Diseases, I
<span class = "pagenum">41</span>
shall prescribe some Remedies, and so Conclude.</p>


<h5 class = "ital">Cures for Hawks Diseases.</h5>

<p>The good Faulconer ought diligently to observe the Complexions of his
<i>Hawks Castings</i> and <i>Mewtings</i>, to judge of their Maladies,
and is prescribed by some as an excellent way; and is indeed so; but an
assured sign of knowing whether they are sick or distempered is this.
Take your <i>Hawk</i>, turning up her Train, if you see her Tuel or
Fundiment swelleth, or looketh red; Or, if her Eyes or Eares be of a
fiery Complexion, it is an infallible sign of her being not well and in
good health; and then Scouring is necessary first; which is done by the
most Soveraign <i>Aloes Cicatrine</i>, about the quantity of a Bean,
wrapt up in her Meat; and this avoids Grease, and kills Wormes too.</p>

<p><i>For the Cataract</i>: Take one Scruple of washt <i>Aloes</i>
finely beaten, and two Scruples of <i>Sugar-candy</i>, mix these
together, and with a Quil blow it three or four times a day into your
<i>Hawks</i> Eye.</p>

<p><i>Pantus</i> or <i>Asthma</i>: Pour the Oyl of sweet <i>Almonds</i>
into a Chickens Gutt,
<span class = "pagenum">42</span>
well washt, and give it the <i>Hawk</i>: Or, scower her with
<i>Sellandine</i>-Pellets, and Oyle of <i>Roses</i>, and then wash her
meat in the Decoction of <i>Coltsfoot</i>.</p>

<p><i>Filanders</i> or <i>Wormes</i>: To prevent them, seeing your Hawk
low and poor, give her once a month a Clove of <i>Garlick</i>. To cure
or kill them; take half a dozen Cloves of <i>Garlick</i>, boyle them
very tender in <i>Milk</i>, then take them and dry the Milk out of them;
put them into a spoonful of the best <i>Oyle of Olives</i>, and having
steept them all Night, give them both to your Hawk, when she has cast,
in the morning; feed her not til two hours after, and then with warm
Meat, and keep her warm all that day.</p>

<p><i>Lice</i>: Mail your Hawk in some Woollen Cloath, put between her
Head and Hood a little Wool, and take a Pipe of <i>Tobacco</i>, put the
little end in at the Tream, blow the smoak, and the Lice that escape
Killing, will creep into the Cloth: <i>Probatum</i>.</p>

<p><i>Formica</i>: Take a little of the Gall of a <i>Bull</i>, and
beating it with <i>Aloes</i>, anoint the Beak of the Hawk, Morning and
Evening.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">43</span>
<p><i>Frounce</i>: Take the Powder of <i>Allume</i>, reduced to a Salve
with strong Wine Vinegar, and wash her mouth with it; then take the
Juice of <i>Lollium</i> and <i>Raddish</i>, mixt with Salt, and anoint
the Sore.</p>

<p><i>Apoplex</i>: Gather the Herb <i>Asterion</i> (the Moon being in
the Waine and in the Sign <i>Virgo</i>) wash your Hawks meat with the
Juice thereof when you feed her, is Soveraign.</p>

<p><i>Wounds</i>: Take the Juice of <i>English Tobacco</i>, or
<i>Mouse-eare</i>, after you have sticht it up, with a little Lint,
bathe the place is highly approved.</p>

<p>Many other Diseases there are, which others have largely treatad of,
and to whom I refer you in case of some Diseases, which may occur; and
here take leave to conclude this my discourse of Hawking:</p>

</p>


<p><span class = "firstletter">T</span>his Noble Art being rightly and
throughly learnt, qualifies a Gentleman for the three preceding Sports,
and is for that Reason placed here, as a necessary Attendant of them.
And here we must first examine the Ends &amp; Design of our proposing
this Art to our selves, &amp; accordingly lay down as briefly as may be
the necessary Rules and Lessons are to be observed and learnt, for the
obtaining and prosecuting the same, and I take these to be the usual
Perfections we aime at, <i>To Ride well the great <em>Horse</em>, for
the Warrs or Service, and the <em>Horse</em> for Pleasure</i>; of both
which as concisely as I can, in their Order.</p>

<p>As a <i>Preface</i> to this, we must begin with <i>Taming a young
Colt</i>. After you have kept your Colt at home some time, and made him
so Familiar with you, as to suffer <i>Combing</i>, <i>Currying</i>,
<i>Handling</i>, and <i>Stroaking</i> any part, ’tis high time then to
offer him the Saddle, which you must lay in the <i>Manger</i> first,
that by its smell, he may not be afraid of it, or the <i>Styrrups</i>
Noise.
<span class = "pagenum">45</span>
Then gently saddling him (after his dressing) take a sweet <i>Watring
Trench</i>, anointed with Honey and Salt, and place it in his Mouth so,
that it may hang directly over his <i>Tush</i>; then lead him abroad in
your hand, and Water him; and after he has stood an hour rein’d thus,
take off his Bridle and Saddle, and let him feed till Evening; Then do
as in the morning; then dress and Cloath him, having <i>Cherisht</i> him
before, <i>i. e.</i> By the <i>Voice</i> delivered smoothly and gently;
or by the <i>Hand</i> by gently stroaking and clapping him on the neck,
or buttock; or lastly by the <i>Rod</i>, by rubbing it on his Withers or
Main.</p>

<p>On the next day as before; and after that, put him on a strong
<i>Musrole</i>, or sharp <i>Cavezan</i>, and <i>Martingale</i>; which is
the best guide to a Horse for setting his Head in due place, forming the
Rein, and appearing Gracefull and Comely; it corrects the yerking out
his Head, or Nose, and prevents his running away with his Rider. Observe
therefore to place it right, that it be not buckled straight, but loose,
and so low, that it rest on the tender Grissle of his Nose, to make him
the
<span class = "pagenum">46</span>
more sensible of his Fault, and Correction; and so as you see you win
his Head, bring him straighter by degrees; let him but gently feel it,
till his Head be brought to its true Perfection.</p>

<p>Having observed this well, lead him forth into some soft or new
Plowed Land, and to take off his wanton knavish Tricks, trot him about
in your hand a good while: Then offer to Mount; if he refuse to suffer
you, Trot him again; then putting your foot into the <i>Styrrop</i>,
mount half way; if he takes it impatient, correct him, and about again;
if not cherish him, and place your self a moment in the Saddle,
dismount, cherish, and feed him with <i>Grass</i>, or <i>Bread</i>: All
things being well, remount, even in the Saddle, keeping your Rod from
his Eye; then let one lead him by the <i>Chaff-Halter</i>, and ever and
a-non make him stand, and cherish him, till he will of his one accord go
forward; then come home, alight gently, and do a good Horsemans Duty,
<i>To dress and feed him well</i>. This Course in few dayes will bring
him to Trot, by following some other Horseman, stop him now and then
gently, and forward; not forgetting seasonable
<span class = "pagenum">47</span>
<i>Cherishings</i> and <i>Corrections</i>, by <i>Voice</i>,
<i>Bridle</i>, <i>Rod</i>, <i>Spurs</i>.</p>

<p>Being thus brought to some certainty of <i>Reine</i>, and
<i>Trotting</i> forth-right, then to the <i>Treading forth of the large
Rings</i>. And here first examine your Horses Nature, before you choose
your Ground, for, if his Nature be dull and sloathful, yet strong, then
<i>New-plow’d-Field</i> is best; if <i>Active</i>, <i>Quick</i>, and
<i>Fiery</i>, then <i>Sandy-ground</i> is to be preferred; in the most
proper of which mark out a large Ring, of a Hundred Paces circumference.
Now then walk about it on the right seven or eight times, then by a
little straightning your right Rein, and laying your left Leg Calf to
his side, make a half Circle within the Ring upon your right down to its
Center; then by straightning a little your left Rein, and laying your
right Leg Calf to his side, make a half Circle to your left hand, from
the Center to the outmost Verge, and these you see contrary turned make
a Roman&nbsp;S. Now to your first large Compass, walk him about on your
left hand, as oft as before on the right, and change to your right
within your Ring; then Trot him first on the right-hand, then on the
left, as long as
<span class = "pagenum">48</span>
you judge fit, and as often Mornings, and Evenings as the Nature of your
Horse shall require. In the same manner you may make him to
<i>Gallop</i> the same Rings, though you must not enter it all at once,
but by degrees, first a Quarter, then a Half-quarter; and the Lightness
and Cheerfulness of your Body, not the Spur, must induce him
to&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>The next Lesson is to <i>Stop Fair, Comely, and without Danger</i>.
First see that the Ground be hard and firm, then having cherisht your
Horse, bring him to a swift Trot, about Fifty Paces, and then straightly
and suddenly draw in your Bridle hand; then ease a little your hand to
make him give backward, and in so doing, give him liberty, and cherish
him; then drawing in your Bridle hand, make him retire, and go back; if
he strike, ease your hand; if he refuse, let some by-stander put him
back, that he may learn your intention; and thus he may Learn these Two
Lessons at once.</p>

<p><i>To Advance before</i>, when he stoppeth, is thus taught: When you
stop your Horse, without easing your hand, lay close and hard to his
sides both the
<span class = "pagenum">49</span>
<span class = "folionum">D</span>
Calves of your Legs, and shaking your Rod cry, <i>Up, Up</i>; which he
will understand by frequent Repetition, and Practice: This is a
Gracefull, and Comely Motion, makes a Horse Agile, and Nimble, and ready
to Turn; and therefore be carefull in it: That he take up his Legs
<i>Even</i> together, and bending to his Body; not too high, for fear of
his coming over; not sprawling, or pawing; or for his own pleasure; in
these faults correct him with Spur and Rod.</p>

<p>To <i>Yerk out behind</i> is the next Lesson, thus learnt: Presently
upon your making him stop, give him a good brisk jerk near his Flank,
which will make him soon understand you. When he does it, cherish him;
and see he does it comely, for to yerk out his hinder Legs, till his
Forelegs be above ground, is not graceful; or one Leg yerk’t further out
than the other; or one Leg out while the other is on the ground; in this
case a single Spur on the faulty side is best. But to help him in
Yerking, staying his mouth on the Bridle, striking your Rod under his
belly, or touching him on the Rump with it, are reckoned necessary.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">50</span>
<p>To <i>Turn readily on both hands</i>, thus: Bring his large Rings
narrower, &amp; therein gently walk him, till acquainted. Then carry
your Bridle-hand steady and straight, the outmost rather straighter then
the inmost Rein, to look from, rather than to the Ring; Trot him thus
about, on one side and the other successively, as aforesaid. After some
time stop, and make him advance twice or more, and retire in an even
Line; then stop and cherish him. To it again, after the same manner,
making him lap his outmost Leg above a foot over his inner. And thus the
<i>Terra a Terra</i>, <i>Incavalere</i> &amp; <i>Chambletta</i>, are all
taught together. Perfect your Horse in the large Ring, and the straight
Ring is easily learnt.</p>

<p>Your Horse being brought thus far to perfection, with the
<i>Musrole</i> and <i>Trench</i>, now let a gentle <i>Cavezan</i> take
their place; with a smooth Cannon-Bit in his Mouth, &amp; a&nbsp;plain
watering Chain, Cheek large, and the Kirble thick, round and big,
loosely hanging on his nether Lip; and thus mount him, and perfect your
Horse with the <i>Bit</i> in all the ’foresaid Lessons, as you did with
the <i>Snaffle</i>; which indeed is the easier to be done of the
two.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">51</span>
<span class = "folionum">D2</span>
<p>To teach your Horse <i>To go aside</i>, as a necessary Motion for
shunning a blow from an Enemy, is thus: Draw up your Bridle-hand
somewhat straight, and if you would have him go on the Right, lay your
left Rein close to his Neck, and your left Calf likewise close to his
side (as in the <i>Incavalere</i> before) making him lap his left Leg
over his Right; then turning your Rod backward, jerking him on the left
hinder Thigh gently, make him to bring to the right side his Hinder
parts, and stand as at first in an even direct Line: Then make him
remove his Fore parts more, that he may stand as it were Cross over the
even Line, and then bring his hinder parts after, and stand in an even
Line again. And thus you must do, if you would have him go on the Left
hand, using your Corrections &amp; Cherishings on the right. Use it, and
you may be sure of Perfection.</p>

<p>As for the <i>Manages</i>, somewhat have bin spoken of them, there
being but two (among many) useful call’d <i>Terra a Terra &amp;
Incavalere</i> before treated of; &amp; for the <i>Carreere</i>, only
take this: Let it not extend in length above six-score yards, give your
Horse warning before you start
<span class = "pagenum">52</span>
him by the Bridle hand, and running full speed, stop him suddenly, firme
and close on his Buttock.</p>

<p>For the <i>Horse of Pleasure</i>, these following Lessons are to be
learnt. As first to <i>Bound aloft</i>, to do which: Trot him some
sixteen yards, then stop, and make him twice advance; then straighten
your Bridle-hand; then clap briskly both your Spurs even together to
him, and he will rise, though it may at first amaze him; if he does it,
cherish him, and repeat it often every day, till perfect.</p>

<p>Next to <i>Corvet</i> and <i>Capriole</i> are Motions of the same
nature, and in short are thus taught. Hollow the ground between two
joyning Walls a Horses Length, by the side of which put a strong smooth
Post of the same length from the Wall, and fasten at the Wall an Iron
Ring over against the Post: Thus done, ride into the hollow place, and
fasten one of the <i>Cavezan-Reins</i> to the Post, and the other to the
Ring; then cherish him, and by the help of the Calves of your Legs, make
him advance two or three times; then pause, and Cherish him; make him
advance again a dozen times more, and then rest; double your Advancings,
<span class = "pagenum">53</span>
and repeat them till it becomes habitual to him, to keep his
<i>Ground</i> certain, advance of an <i>equall height</i> before and
behind, and observe a <i>due Time</i> with the motions of your Leggs.
The Inequality of his advancing his hinder Legs, is helpt by a Jerk on
the Fillets by some body behind him with a Rod.</p>

<p>The laborious Motion of <i>going sideways</i>, being fitter for the
War-Horse, than the Horse for Pleasure, usefull for the avoiding a Blow
may come from an Enemy, I&nbsp;omit here, refering you to that.</p>

<p>Thus much for those material Lessons which the Rider ought to teach
his Horse for <i>War</i> or <i>Pleasure</i>, and therefore I shall
conclude this Head, with this <i>Caveat</i>, <i>That in whatever Lesson
your Horse is most imperfect, begin and end with</i>; and remember, that
<i>Exercise</i> makes things as it were natural; when <i>Desuetude</i>
is the forerunner of Forgetfulness, and <i>Ignorance</i> the Consequent
of Both.</p>

<p><span class = "firstletter">I</span> shall not enlarge on the praises
of this Recreation, its <i>Nobleness</i>, <i>Delight</i>, and
<i>Simplicity</i>, devoyd of Cheat or Deceit, but what is most material
to our purpose succinctly declare. And herein let us first observe the
<i>Choice</i> of a <i>Cock</i> of the Game, directed by these four
Characters following: That he be</p>

<p>1. Of a strong <i>Shape</i>, proud and upright, and for this the
<i>Middle-sized</i>, neither too small or too large, is best, because
most matchable, strong and nimble. His <i>Head</i> small like a
<i>Spar-Hawks</i>; his <i>Eye</i> large and quick; <i>Back</i> strong,
crook’t at the setting on, and coloured as the Plume of his Feathers;
The <i>Beam of his Leg</i> very strong, and colour’d as his Plume;
<i>Spurs</i> long, rough, and sharp, hooking inward.</p>

<p>2. Of a good <i>Colour</i>, and herein the Gray, Yellow, or Red Pyle,
with a black Breast, are to be preferred; the
<span class = "pagenum">55</span>
<span class = "folionum">D4</span>
Pyde rarely good, and the White and Dun never. A&nbsp;Scarlet Head is a
demonstration of Courage, but a Pale and wan of Faintness.</p>

<p>3. Of <i>Courage</i> true, which you shall observe by his proud,
stately, upright Standing and Walking, and his frequent Crowing in his
Pen.</p>

<p>4. Of a <i>Sharp and ready Heel</i>, which is (in the Opinion of the
best <i>Cock-Masters</i>,) of high Estimation; a&nbsp;<i>Sharp-heel’d
Cock, tho somewhat false, is better</i> (as dispatching his business
soonest) <i>than a true Cock with a dull Heel</i>. Enfine choose your
<i>Cock</i> endued with all these Qualifications together above
mentioned.</p>

<p>For <i>Breeding</i> good Cocks for the Game, or Battel, the best
season is from the Moon’s Encrease in <i>February</i>, to her Encrease
in <i>March</i>. The <i>March</i> Bird is best. And now first get a
<i>perfect Cock, to a perfect Hen</i>, as the best Breeding, and see the
Hen be of an excellent Complexion (<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>) rightly plumed, as
black, brown, speckt, grey, grissel, or yellowish; tufted on her Crowne,
large bodied, well poked, and having Weapons, are Demonstrations of
Excellency and Courage. Observe
<span class = "pagenum">56</span>
further her Comportment, if friendly to her Chickens, and revengeful of
Injuries from other Hens. <i>Fortes creantur a Fortibus.</i></p>

<p>Having placed her <i>Nest</i>, private from other Fowles disturbance,
and warme, observe your Hen in sitting, if she be busie in turning her
Eggs; if remiss, to help her. Set by her Sand, Gravel, Water and
necessary food, to prevent her Straggling.</p>

<p>After one and twenty dayes observe her <i>Hatching</i>, to take the
newly hatcht Chickens, and wrap them in Wool and keep them warm by the
fire till all be disclosed; then put them all under her, and let her
keep them warm, and let none of them straggle abroad till they are three
Weeks, or a Month old; and then let them run in some Grass-plat, or
green Court, to pick Wormes, Grass and Chick-weed, to feed and scour
themselves; but let them not ramble near Puddles, or filthy Channels;
and to prevent any malady, a&nbsp;few Leek-blades minc’d small amongst
their Meat is good.</p>

<p>When they are grown so, as that their Sexes may be distinguish’t,
assoon as the <i>Comb</i> or <i>Wattles</i> but appear, cut them away,
and anoint the Sore with sweet
<span class = "pagenum">57</span>
<span class = "folionum">D5</span>
<i>Butter</i>, till whole. This early cutting them, is highly necessary
to prevent Flux of Blood, (which is dangerous in doing it later) and
Gouty thick Heads.</p>

<p>When the <i>Cock</i>, and <i>Hen-Chickens</i>, (going till now
promiscuously one with another) begin to quarrel and peck each other,
part them and separate their <i>Walks</i>: And the best for a
<i>Fighting-Cock</i>, are private and undisturbed <i>Walks</i>, as,
<i>Wind-mills</i>, <i>Water-mills</i>, <i>Grange-houses</i>,
<i>Park-lodges</i>, &amp;c. and their <i>Feeding-place</i> on soft
Ground, or Boards; and have for his Meat, <i>White Corn</i>, or
<i>White-bread Tosts</i>, steept in <i>Drink</i>, or <i>Urine</i>, is
good, both to Scowre, and Cool them. And do not debilitate and debauch
his Courage and Strength, by having too many <i>Hens</i> to walk with;
Three <i>Hens</i> are enough for one <i>Cock</i>.</p>

<p>If before they be Six Months Old any of your <i>Chickens</i>
<i>Crow</i> clear and loud, and unseasonable, then to the <i>Pot</i> or
<i>Spit</i> with them, they are <i>Cowards</i>; the true <i>Cock</i> is
long ere he gets his Voice, and when he has gotten it, keeps good and
judicious <i>Time</i> in Crowing.</p>

<p>Next observe your <i>Roosting-Perch</i>, for this makes or marrs a
<i>Cock</i>; for forming
<span class = "pagenum">58</span>
of which, consult the best <i>Cock-Masters</i> Feeding-Pens, and the
Perches there, and accordingly proportion your own, therefore I shall
not propose any form here; Only pray take care that the ground
underneath the Perch be soft, for if the ground be rough and hard, in
leaping down he will hurt his <i>Feet</i>, and make them Gouty and
Knotty.</p>

<p>For the <i>Dieting</i>, and <i>Ordering</i> of your <i>Cock</i> for
<i>Battle</i>, observe these Rules. Let your <i>Cock</i> be full two
years Old, then in the latter end of <i>August</i>, take up and
<i>Pen</i> him, (it being now <i>Cocking-time</i> till the end of
<i>May</i>) and see that he be sound, hard-feather’d, and full summed.
As to the moving <i>Perch</i>, and <i>Pen</i>, take my foregoing
Advice.</p>

<p>The first four dayes after <i>Penning</i>; Feed him with the Crumb of
Old <i>Manchet</i> cut into square bits, thrice a day, and with the
Coldest, and Sweetest Spring-water that can be had. And after you think
by this time he is throughly purged of his <i>Corne</i>, <i>Wormes</i>,
<i>Gravel</i>, and other course Feeding, take him in the Morning out of
the <i>Pen</i>, and let him <i>Sparr</i> with another <i>Cock</i> some
time to heat and chafe their Bodies, break
<span class = "pagenum">59</span>
Fat and Glut, and fit them for Purgation; first having covered their
Spurs with Hots of Leather, to hinder their Wounding and drawing Blood
of one another.</p>

<p>After they have sufficiently <i>Sparred</i>, that they pant again,
take them up, and remove their Hots, and prepare them for a Diaphoretick
or Sweating Bout thus: Take <i>Butter</i>, and <i>Rosemary</i> finely
chopt, and <i>White-Sugar-candy</i>, mixt together; and give them the
quantity of a <i>Wallnut</i>; which will scower, strengthen, and prolong
Breath: Then having (purposely) deep <i>Straw Baskets</i>, fill them
half way with <i>Straw</i>, put in your <i>Cock</i>, and cover him with
<i>Straw</i> to the top; lay the lid close, and let him stove till the
Evening. At Five a Clock take him out, and lick his Head and Eyes with
your Tongue, then Pen him, and fill his <i>Trough</i> with
<i>Manchet</i> (as above) and hot <i>Urine</i>.</p>

<p>After this, let his <i>Diet</i> be of <i>Bread</i> thus made: Take a
<i>Gallon</i> of <i>Wheat</i>, and <i>Oat-meal-flower</i>, and with
<i>Ale</i>, half a score <i>Whites</i> of <i>Eggs</i>, and
<i>Butter</i>, work it into a stiff <i>Paste</i>; bake it into broad
<i>Cakes</i>, and when four dayes Old, cut it into square Bits, as
abovesaid.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">60</span>
<p>The second day after <i>Sparring</i>, bring your <i>Cock</i> into a
<i>Green Close</i>, and shew him in your Arms a <i>Dung-hill-Cock</i>,
then run from him, and allure him thus to follow, suffering him now and
then to strike the <i>Dunghill-Cock</i>, and so Chase him up and down
for half an Hour, till he pants again; and thus heated, carry him home,
and scower him with half a Pound of <i>Fresh-Butter</i>, beaten with the
<i>Leaves</i> of the <i>Herb</i> of <i>Grace</i>, <i>Hysop</i>, and
<i>Rosemary</i>, to the consistence of a <i>Salve</i>, and give him the
quantity of a <i>VVallnut</i>, then <i>Stove</i>, and <i>Feed</i> him as
above. And thus for the first <i>Fortnight</i>, <i>Spar</i> or
<i>Chase</i> him every other day.</p>

<p>The second <i>Fortnight</i>, twice a Week will be enough to
<i>Chase</i> or <i>Spar</i> your <i>Cock</i>: Observing, that you
<i>Stove</i> and <i>Scower</i> him, proportionable to his Heating.</p>

<p>The Third and Last <i>Fortnight</i> (for Six Weeks is long enough)
<i>Feed</i> him as before, but do not <i>Spar</i> him, but Chase him
moderately twice, or thrice, as before; then roll his aforesaid scowring
in <i>Brown-Sugar-candy</i>, to prevent his being Sick; rest him four
dayes, and then to the Pit.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">61</span>
<p>Now, Gentlemen, <i>Match</i> your Cock Carefully, or what you have
hitherto done, is nothing. And here Observe the <i>Length</i>, and
<i>Strength</i> of Cocks. The <i>Length</i> is thus known: Gripe the
Cock by the Waste, and make him shoot out his Legs, and in this Posture
compare, <i>And have your Judgment about you.</i> The <i>Strength</i> is
known by this Maxime, <i>The largest in the Garth, is the strongest
Cock.</i> The Dimension of the <i>Garth</i>, is thus known: Gripe the
Cock about from the joynts of your Thumb, to the points of your Great
<i>Finger</i>, and you will find the Disadvantage. <i>The weak long
<em>Cock</em> is the quickest easier Riser, and the short strong one,
the surest Striker.</i></p>

<p>Thus being well Matcht, accoutre him for the Pit. Clip his
<i>Main</i> off close to his Neck, from his head to his shoulders. Clip
his <i>Tail</i> close to his <i>Rump</i>, the Redder it appears the
better. His <i>Wings</i> sloping, with sharp Points [ware Eye
Adversary:] Scrape smooth, and sharpen his <i>Spurs</i>; leave no
feathers on his Crown; then moisten his head with Spittle; and now
favour us Fortune.</p>

<p class = "space">
The Battle done search, and suck your Cocks wounds, and wash them well
with
<span class = "pagenum">62</span>
hot <i>Urine</i>, then give him a Roll of your best Scowring, and stove
him for that Night. If he be swelled, the next morning, suck and bathe
his Wounds again, and pounce them with the Powder of the Herb
<i>Robert</i>, thro a fine Bag; give him an handfull of Bread in warm
Urine, and stove him, till the swelling be down. If he be hurt in his
Eye, chew a little ground <i>Ivy</i>, and Spit the Juice in it; which is
good for <i>Films</i>, <i>Haws</i>, <i>Warts</i>, &amp;c. Or if he hath
<i>veined</i> himself in his fight, by narrow striking, or other cross
blows, when you have found the hurt, bind the soft Down of Hare to it,
will cure&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>When you visit your wounded <i>Cocks</i>, a month or two after you
have put them to their Walks, if you find about their heads any swollen
Bunches, hard and blackish at one end, then there are unsound Cores
undoubtedly in them; therefore open them, and with your Thumb crush them
out, suck out the Corruption, and fill the holes with fresh Butter; and
that will infallibly cure them.</p>


<span class = "pagenum">63</span>
<h5 class = "ital">Cures for Distempers incident to the Cock or Chick of
the Game.</h5>

<p>For <i>Lice</i>, being most common, I begin with; proceeding from
corrupt Meat, and want of Bathing, <i>&amp;c.</i> Take <i>Pepper</i>
beaten to Powder, mix it with warm Water, and wash them
with&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>For the <i>Roup</i>; a filthy swelling on the Rump, and very
contagious to the whole body, the staring and turning back of the
Feathers is it Symptome. Pull away the Feathers, open and thrust out the
Core, and wash the Sore with Water and Salt, or Brine.</p>

<p>For the <i>Pip</i>; visit the mouth, and examine what hinders your
<i>Cocks</i>, <i>Hen</i>, or <i>Chicks</i> feeding, and you’ll find a
white thin Scale on the Tip of the Tongue, which pull off with your
Naile, and rubbing the Tongue with Salt, will cure&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>For the <i>Flux</i>; proceeding from eating too moist Meat, give them
Pease-Bran scalded, will stop&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>For the <i>Stoppage of the Belly</i>, that they cannot mute; Anoint
their Vents, and give them either small bits of
<span class = "pagenum">64</span>
Bread or Corn, steep’d in Urine of Man.</p>

<p>For the <i>Eyes</i>, I have spoken before, and refer you to that; and
for other Infirmities, let Practise be your Directory.</p>

<p class = "space">
And now I have one Word of Advice to him that is a Lover (or would be
so) of this <i>Royal-Sport</i>; and then have done: <i>Come not to the
Pitt without Money in your Breeches, and a Judgment of Matches</i>;
<b>Done</b> and <b>Done</b> is <i>Cock-Pitt</i> <b>Law</b>, and if you
venture beyond your Pocket, you must look well to it, or you may loose
an Eye by the Battle.</p>

</p>


<p><span class = "firstletter">T</span>his is a Recreation so full of
<i>Variety</i>; that it would take up a great many <i>Words</i> and
<i>Time</i> to discover it; but varying indeed from this Design,
I&nbsp;shall not dilate on its several parts, but as succinctly as may
be, give you some methodical <i>Instructions</i>, as may make a man
capable of the <i>Active</i> as well as <i>Passive</i> part of this
Pleasure, and without the one he cannot have the other.</p>

<p>Now then the <i>Ingenious Fowler</i>, like a Politick and sagacious
Warrior, must first furnish and store himself with those several
Stratagems and Engines, as suit with the diversities of <i>Occasion</i>
(<i>i.&nbsp;e. Time</i>,) <i>Place</i>, and <i>Game</i>; or else he
cannot expect the <i>Conquest</i>.</p>

<p>And first of <i>Nets</i>, which must be made of the best pack-thread,
and for taking <i>Great Fowl</i>, the Meshes must be large, two Inches
at least from point to point, the larger the better; (provided the Fowle
creep not through;) two Fathom <i>deep</i>, and six in <i>Length</i>, is
the
<span class = "pagenum">66</span>
best and most manageable Proportion; Verged with strong Cord on each
side, and extended with long Poles at each end made on purpose. But for
small <i>Water-Fowle</i>; Let your Nets be of the smallest and strongest
Pack-thread, the Meshes so big, as for the great Fowle, about two or
three foot deep: Line these on both sides with false Nets, every Mesh a
foot and half Square. For the <i>Day-Net</i>, it must be made of fine
Pack-thread, the Mesh an inch square, three Fathom long, and one broad,
and extended on Poles according to its Length, as aforesaid.</p>

<p><i>Birdlime</i> is the next, and thus made. Pill the <i>Bark of
Holly</i> from the Tree at <i>Midsummer</i>, fill a Vessel, and put to
it running Water; boile it over the fire till the <i>Grey</i> and
<i>White Bark</i> rise from the <i>Green</i>; take it off the fire,
draine the Water well away, and seperate the Barks; and take the Green,
lay it on some moist floor and close place, and cover it with
<i>Hemblocks</i>, <i>Docks</i>, <i>Thistles</i>, and all manner of
Weeds; let it lye a fortnight, and in that time it will rot, and turn to
a filthy slimy Substance: Then put it into a Morter, beat it till you
perceive not what it
<span class = "pagenum">67</span>
was; take it out and wash it soundly at some running stream, till the
Foulness is gone: Then put it in a close Earthen pot; let it stand four
or five dayes, look to its Purging, and scum it: When clean, put it into
another Earthen Pot, and keep it close for Use.</p>

<p>Your <i>Setting-Dog</i> comes next, and sayes you must <i>Elect</i>
and <i>Train</i> him thus: He must be of exquisite Scent, and love
naturally to hunt Feathers. The <i>Land-Spaniel</i> is best, being of
good nimble size, and couragious mettle, which you may know by his
Breed; being of a good Ranger, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<p>Having chosen your Dog, begin to <i>instruct</i> him at half a Year
old. First make him familiar and acquainted well with your self above
others, by feeding him your self, alwayes going abroad with you, and
correcting him with <i>Words</i> not Blows. So that he will follow none
but you, distinguish your Frowns from smiles, rough from smooth
Words.</p>

<p>The first Lesson is, to make him <i>Crouch and lie down</i> close to
the ground; and this is done by frequent laying him on the ground and
crying <i>Lye close</i>; upon his doing well reward him with Bread;
<span class = "pagenum">68</span>
and on the contrary chastise him with Words, not Blows.</p>

<p>Next, To <i>creep to you with his Body and Head close upon the
ground</i>, by saying, <i>Come nearer, Come nearer</i>, or the like
Words; to understand and do it, entice him with shewing him Bread, or
the like: Thrusting down any rising part of his Body or head, and
roughly threatning him; if he slight that, a&nbsp;good Jerk or two with
a slash of Whip-cord will reclaim his Obstinacy. Repeat his Lessons, and
incourage his well doing. And this you may exercise in the Fields as you
walk, calling him from his busie Ranging to his <i>Duty</i>. And then
teach him to follow you close at the heels in a Line or string, without
straining.</p>

<p>By this time he is a year old, now (the season fit) into the Field,
and let him <i>range</i>, [obediently.] If he wantonly babble or
causelesly open, correct him by biting soundly the Roots of his
Ears,<!--eek! --> or Lashing. Assoon as you find he approaches the Haunt
of the <i>Partridge</i>, known by his Whining, and willing, but not
daring, to open, speak and bid him, <i>Take heed</i>: If notwithstanding
this he rush in and <i>Spring</i> the <i>Partridge</i>,
<span class = "pagenum">69</span>
or opens, and so they escape, correct him severely. Then cast him off to
another Haunt of a <i>Covie</i>, and if he mends his Error, and you take
any by drawing your Net over them swiftly, reward them with the Heads,
Necks, and Pinions.</p>

<p>As for the <i>Water-Dog</i>, the Instructions above for the
<i>Setter</i> will serve; only to fetch and bring by loosing a Glove, or
the like, is every mans common Observation, and therefore shall here for
Brevities sake omit; only keep a strict Subjection in him, and
Observance to your Commands.</p>

<p>I shall say something too of the <i>Fowling-Piece</i> and
<i>Stalking-Horse</i>, and then to your sports. The longest <i>Barrel is
the best Fowling-Peice</i>, five and half, or six foot long, with an
indifferent Bore, under an <i>Harquebuse</i>; and shooting with the
Wind, and side-wayes, or behind the Fowl, not in their faces, is to be
observed; having your Dog in Command not to stir till you have shot.</p>

<p>A <i>Stalking-Horse</i> for shelter, to avoid being seen by the shie
Fowle, is an old Jade trained on purpose; but this being rare and
troublesome, have recourse to Art, to take Canvas,
<span class = "pagenum">70</span>
stuft and painted in the shape of a Horse grazing, and so light that you
may carry him on one hand (not too bigg:) Others do make them in the
shape of <i>Ox</i>, <i>Cow</i>, for Variety; and <i>Stag</i>,
<i>Trees</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<p>Thus being provided with necessary Engines for prosecuting and
effecting so cunning and pleasant a work, <i>Let’s abroad</i>; and let
not the <i>Ale-House</i>, <i>Tavern</i>, or <i>Brothel-Houses</i>,
debauch and benumn our Spirits, but let us with the Fowler exhilerate
our Minds, refresh our Bodies, &amp; for a little Pains reap a great
deal of Pleasure &amp; Satisfaction, whet our Appetites, and get Meat
too for them.</p>

<p>Now then according to my proposed Method, let us first examine
<i>Where</i> to find our Game? that is, The <i>Haunts of Fowle</i>,
whether <i>Land</i> or <i>Water</i> Fowle; by which two Characters I
distinguish them, because of their Variety and Multiplicity.</p>

<p>The <i>greater Fowle</i>, or those who <i>divide the Foot</i>, reside
by shallow Rivers sides, Brooks and Plashes of Water; and in low and
boggy places, and sedgie, Marish, rotten Grounds. They also delight in
the dry parts of drowned Fens, overgrown with long Reeds, Rushes and
Sedges; as likewise in half-drowned
<span class = "pagenum">71</span>
Moors, hollow Vales of Downs, Heaths, <i>&amp;c.</i> Where obscurely
they may lurk under the Shelter of Hedges, Hills, Bushes,
<i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<p>The <i>Lesser</i>, or Web-footed, <i>Fowle</i>, allwayes haunt
drowned Fens, as likewise the main streams of Rivers not subject to
Freeze, the deeper and broader, the better; (tho of these the
<i>Wild-Goose</i> and <i>Barnacle</i>, if they cannot sound the depth,
and reach the Ouze, change their Residence for shallow places, and
delight in Green-Winter-Corn, especially if the Lands ends have Water
about them:) <i>Small Fowle</i> also frequent hugely little Brooks,
Ponds, drowned Meadows, Pastures, Moors, Plashes, Meres, Loughs, and
Lakes, stored with unfrequented Islands, Shrubs, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>


<h5 class = "ital">How to take all manner of Fowl or Birds.</h5>

<p>For taking the first (I mean the greater <i>Fowle</i>) with
<i>Nets</i>, observe in general this: Come two hours before their
feeding hours, Morning and Evening; and spreading your Net on the Ground
smooth and flat, stake the two lower ends firm, and let the upper ends
be
<span class = "pagenum">72</span>
extended on the long Cord; of which the further end must be fastned to
the ground, three Fathom from the Net, the stake in a direct Line with
the lower Verge of the Net; the other, ten or twelve fathoms long, have
in your hand at the aforesaid distance, and get some shelter of Art or
Nature, to keep you from the curious and shie Eye of your Game; having
your Net so ready that the least pull may do your work, Strew’d over
with Grass as it lies to hide it: A&nbsp;live <i>Herne</i>, or some
other Fowle lately taken, according to what you seek for, will be very
requisite for a <i>Stale</i>. And you will have sport from the Dawning,
till the Sun is about an hour high; but no longer; and from Sun-set till
Twilight; these being their feeding times.</p>

<p>For the <i>small</i> (Water) <i>Fowle</i>. Observe the Evening is
best before Sun-set. Stake down your Nets on each side the River half a
foot within the Water, the lower part so plumb’d as to sink no further;
the upper slantwise shoaling against, but not touching by two foot, the
Water, and the Strings which bear up this upper side fastned to small
yeilding sticks prickt in the Bank,
<span class = "pagenum">73</span>
<span class = "folionum">E</span>
that as the Fowle strike may ply to the Nets to entangle them. And thus
lay your Nets (as many as you please) about twelve score one from
another, as the River or Brook will afford. And doubt not your success.
To expedite it however, a&nbsp;<i>Gun</i> fired three or four times in
the <i>Fens</i> and <i>Plashes</i>, a&nbsp;good distance from your Nets,
will affright and post them to your Snares; and so do at the
<i>Rivers</i>, when you lay in the <i>Fens</i>. Thus much in general for
<i>Nets</i>, I&nbsp;come next to <i>Bird-Lime</i>.</p>

<p><i>Winter time</i> is the most proper for taking all manner of
<i>Small Birds</i>, as flocking then promiscuously together,
<i>Larks</i>, <i>Lennets</i>, <i>Chaffinches</i>, <i>Goldfinches</i>,
<i>Yellow-Hammers</i>, &amp;c<ins class = "correction" title =
". invisible">. </ins>with this <i>Bird-lime</i>, made as afore-spoken;
only additionally thus ordered. Put to a quarter of a pound of
<i>Bird-lime</i>, an Ounce of fresh <i>Lard</i>, or
<i>Capons-grease</i>, and let it gently melt together over the Fire, but
not Boyl; then take a quantity of <i>Wheat-ears</i>, as you think your
use shall require, and cut the straw about a foot long besides the Ears,
and from the Ear <i>Lime</i> the straw Six inches; the warmer it is, the
less discernable it will be: Then to the <i>Field</i> adjacent,
<span class = "pagenum">74</span>
carrying a bag of Chaff, <ins class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘aud’">and</ins>
thresh’d Ears, scatter them twenty Yards wide, and
stick the <i>lim’d Ears</i> (declining downwards) here, and there; Then
traverse the <i>Fields</i>, disturb their <i>Haunts</i>, they will
repair to your Snare, and pecking at the Ears, finding they stick to
them, mount; and the <ins class = "correction" title =
"‘d’ invisible"><i>Lim’d</i></ins> straws, lapping under their Wings, dead
their flight, they cannot be disengaged, but fall and be taken they
must. Do not go near them, till they rise of their own accord, and let
not five or six entangled lead you to spoyl your Game, and incur the
loss of five or six dozen. <i>Barn-doors</i>, <i>Thatcht-Houses</i>, and
such like places, are excellent too for the use of these
<i>Lime-straws</i>. <i>A Clap- Net</i>, and <i>Lanthorn</i>, in a dark
night rub’d at the Eaves of Houses, is a common practice.</p>

<p><i>Lime-Twigs</i>, is another Expedient for taking of Great
<i>Fowle</i>, being Rods that are long, small, straight, and pliable,
the upper part (apt to play to and fro) being besmeared with
<i>Bird-lime</i> warm. Thus to be used, Observe the Haunt<span class =
"missing">s</span> of the <i>Fowle</i>, have a <i>Stale</i>,
(a&nbsp;livin<span class = "missing">g </span> Fowle of the same kind
you would take<span class = "missing">)</span> and cross pricking your
Rods, one into,
<span class = "pagenum">75</span>
<span class = "folionum">E2</span>
and another against the Wind sloping, a&nbsp;foot distant one from the
other, pin down your <ins class = "correction" title =
"‘e’ invisible"><i>Stale</i></ins>, some distance from them, tying some small
string to him, to pull and make him flutter to allure the <i>Fowle</i>
down. If any be caught, do not run presently upon them, their fluttering
will encrease your Game. A&nbsp;well taught <i>Spaniel</i> is not amiss
to retake those that are entangled, and yet flutter away. Thus likewise
for the <i>Water</i>, consult the Rivers depth, and let your Rods be
proportionable; what is <i>Limed</i> of them being above the Water, and
a <i>Mallard</i>, &amp;c. as a <i>Stale</i> placed here and there, as
aforesaid. You need not wait on them, but three times a day visit them,
and see your <i>Game</i>; if you miss any Rods (therefore know their
Number) some Fowle entangled is got away with it, into some Hole,
<i>&amp;c</i>. and here your <i>Spaniel</i> will be serviceable to find
him.</p>

<p>For <i>Small-Birds</i>, a <i>Lime-bush</i> is best; thus, Cut down a
great Bough of a <i>Birch</i>, or <i>Willow-Tree</i>, trim it clean, and
<i>Lime</i> it handsomely, within four fingers of the bottom: Place this
<i>Bush</i> so ordered, in some quick-set, or dead
<span class = "pagenum">76</span>
<i>Hedge</i>, in <i>Spring</i> time: In <i>Harvest</i>, or
<i>Summer</i>, in <i>Groves</i>, <i>Bushes</i>, <i>Hedges</i>,
<i>Fruit-Trees</i>, <i>Flax</i>, and <i>Hemp-Lands</i>: In
<i>Winter</i>, about <i>Houses</i>, <i>Hovells</i>, <i>Barns</i>,
<i>Stacks</i>, &amp;c. A&nbsp;<i>Bird-Call</i> is here also necessary,
or your own industrious skill in the Notes of several Birds.
<i>Lime-twigs</i> are likewise used, stuck on <i>Hemp-cocks</i>, which
take vast Numbers of <i>Lennets</i>, and <i>Green-Birds</i>, that love
that <i>Diet</i>. An <i>Owle</i> placed near your <i>Lime-twigs</i>, is
likewise an Excellent <i>Stale</i>, for being persecuted by all other
<i>Birds</i>, they flock about him, and dye with Hatred; I&nbsp;mean,
being taken by you, in their eager, and malicious Persecution of poor
<i>Tom</i>. Some have Natural, others Artificial <i>Owles</i>, and with
either fear not Success. And thus you may do, in any particular
<i>Game</i>, with your <i>Twigs</i>, and <i>Stale</i> of the same kind,
as, <i>Snipes</i>, <i>Felfares</i>, <i>Pigeons</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>And here I must not forget the <i>Farmers</i> Advantage, to destroy
his <i>Corn</i>-destroyers, <i>Rooks</i>, but give him this Advice: Take
some thick <i>Brown-paper</i>, divide a sheet into Eight parts, and make
them into the fashion of <i>Sugar-Loaves</i>; <i>Lime</i> them a little
in the inside, and put some <i>Corn</i> in them (if in
<span class = "pagenum">77</span>
<span class = "folionum">E3</span>
<i>Ploughing</i> time, <i>Wormes</i>, and <i>Maggots</i>) lay
<i>Three</i> or <i>Four Score</i> up and down the Land, under (if you
can) some Clod, early, before feeding time: Be at some distance, and
behold the ensuing Sport. Your <i>Pigeons</i>, <i>Rooks</i>,
<i>Crows</i>, &amp;c. comeing to pick out the <i>Corn</i> or
<i>Worms</i>, the <i>Pyramidal-snare</i> hangs on their heads, they fly
straight upright, almost out of sight, and as if some <i>Gun</i> in the
Ayr had met with them, down they come tumbling (being spent) and become
your Prey.</p>

<p>Thus much in general of taking all manner of <i>Fowle</i>, by
<i>Net</i>, or <i>Lime</i>, I&nbsp;come next to know their best Seasons,
when to use them, and the first (the <i>Net</i>) is from the beginning
of <i>May</i>, to the latter end of <i>October</i>; and the last (the
<i>Lime</i>) in the <i>Winter</i> only, beginning from <i>November</i>,
and ending at <i>May</i>, in which times, there being no Leaves, your
<i>Lime-Bushes</i>, and <i>Branches</i> of <i>Trees</i> are of one and
the same Hue.</p>

<p>And because Gentlemen who have <i>Fish-ponds</i>, wonder they loose
so many <i>Fish</i>, and are apt to Censure sometimes undeservedly their
Neighbours, when it is the insatiable <i>Hern</i>, that is the true
cause: I&nbsp;shall next lay down the best and
<span class = "pagenum">78</span>
most approved way of taking the great <i>Fish-devouring Herne</i>, whose
<i>Haunt</i> having found, observe this Method to take him. Get three or
four small <i>Roaches</i>, or <i>Dace</i>, take a strong <i>Hook</i>,
(not too rank) with Wyre to it, and draw the Wyre just within the skin,
from the side of the <i>Gills</i>, to the <i>Taile</i> of the said
<i>Fish</i>, and he will live four or five dayes, (if dead, the
<i>Herne</i> will not touch it.) Then having a strong Line, of a
dark-<i>Green-Silk</i>, twisted with Wyre, about three yards long, tye a
round stone of a pound to it, and lay three or four such hooks, but not
too deep in the Water, out of the <i>Herne’s</i> wading; and two or
three Nights will answer your Expectation.</p>

<p>And here I thought to conclude this Discourse of <i>Fowling</i>, but
the young <i>Tyro</i> or <i>Beginner</i> in the Acquest of this Noble
Art, pulls me back again, and whispers this Question in my Ear, How to
take <i>Pheasants</i>, <i>Partridges</i>, &amp;c. in particular, by
either of the forementioned wayes, as, <i>Nets</i>, <i>Lime</i>,
<i>Engine</i>, <i>Driving</i>, or <i>Setting</i>; because of all
<i>Fowl</i> for <i>Game</i>, these two are esteemed as the most Gentile,
and Profitable? I&nbsp;shall answer his Curiosity, and for his
Instruction,
<span class = "pagenum">79</span>
<span class = "folionum">E4</span>
propose these ensuing Rules, though what I have said in general of Great
<i>Fowl</i> might suffice.</p>


<h5 class = "ital">The severall wayes of taking <em>Pheasants</em>.</h5>

<p>For to take <i>Pheasants</i> with <i>Nets</i>, first find their
<i>Haunts</i>, or <i>Coverts</i>, which are generally in thick, young,
well-grown <i>Copses</i>, solitary and untraced by Men or Cattle, and
not in Old High <i>Woods</i>; and never in open <i>Fields</i>. Which
having assured knowledge of, the next thing is to find out the
<i>Eye</i>, or <i>Brood</i> of <i>Pheasants</i>, wich according to the
best Experience is thus. You must learn and understand the several Notes
of a Natural <i>Pheasant-Call</i>, and how usefully to apply them. In
the Morning just before, or at <i>Sun-rising</i>, call them to feed, and
so at <i>Sun-setting</i>: In the <i>Forenoon</i>, and <i>Afternoon</i>,
your Note must be to Cluck them together to <i>Brood</i>, or to chide
them for straggling, or to notify some danger at hand.</p>

<p>Thus skilled in their <i>Notes</i>, and by the Darkness,
Solitaryness, and strong undergrowth of the place assured of their
<i>Haunts</i>, closely lodge your self, and softly at first call; lest
being near
<span class = "pagenum">80</span>
you, a&nbsp;loud <i>Note</i> affright them; and no Reply made, raise
your <i>Note</i> gradually, to the highest; and if there be a
<i>Pheasant</i> in hearing, he will answer you, in as loud a
<i>Note</i>. Be sure it be Tunable. As soon as you are answered, creep
nearer to it; if far off, and a single <i>Fowl</i>, as you call, and
approach, so will the <i>Pheasant</i>. Having gotten sight of her, on
the <i>Ground</i>, or <i>Perch</i>, cease calling, and with all silence
possible, spread your <i>Net</i> conveniently, between the
<i>Pheasant</i>, and you, one end of the <i>Net</i> fastned to the
<i>Ground</i>, and the other end, hold by a long Line in your hand, by
which you may pull it together, if strained; then call again, and as you
see the <i>Pheasant</i> come under your <i>Net</i>, rise and shew your
self, and affrighting her, she will mount, and so is taken. Thus if on
the contrary you have divers <i>Answers</i>, from several <i>Corners</i>
of the <i>Coppice</i>, and you keep your place and not stir, they will
come to your Call, and then having a pair of <i>Nets</i>, spread one on
each side, and do as before. Your <i>Nets</i> must be made of
<i>Green</i> or <i>Black</i> double-twin’d <i>Thread</i>, the
<i>Mesh</i> about an inch square, between <i>Knot</i>, and <i>Knot</i>,
<span class = "pagenum">81</span>
<span class = "folionum">E5</span>
the whole <i>Net</i> about three <i>Fathom</i> long, and Seven
<i>Foot</i> broad, verged with strong small Cord on each side and ends,
to lye hollow and compass-wise.</p>

<p>The next way of taking <i>Pheasant-Powts</i>, is by <i>Driving</i>
thus. Having found the <i>Haunt</i> of an <i>Eye of Pheasants</i>, known
by the <i>Barrenness</i> of the place, <i>Mutings</i> and loose
Feathers, then in the little Pads and Wayes, like Sheep-tracks, they
have made, place your Nets (taking the wind with you) a-cross these <ins
class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘Paths ,ollow’">Paths,
hollow</ins>, loose and circularly, the nether part fixt to the ground,
and the upper side hollow, <i>&amp;c.</i> as aforesaid: Then to their
<i>Haunt</i>, and there <i>call</i> them together, if scattered; then
with a <i>Driver</i>, an Instrument like that of <i>Cloath-dressers</i>,
rake gently the Bushes and Boughs about you, the <i>Powts</i> will run,
and stop and listen; then give a nother rake, and so you will drive them
like sheep into your Nets: Observe in this <i>Secrecy</i>, <i>Time</i>
and <i>Leisure</i>, or you spoyl your sport; <i>Secrecy</i> in
concealing your self from being seen by them; and <i>Time</i> and
<i>Leisure</i>, by not being too hasty.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">82</span>
<p>Lastly for taking <i>Pheasants</i> with the <i>Lime-Bush</i>, or
Rods, order these, as I have before prescribed; your Rods <ins class =
"correction" title = "text reads ‘a- / about’ at line break">about</ins>
twelve Inches long, and your Bush containing not above eight Twigs, with
a pretty long Handle, sharpned to stick in the Ground, or Bushes,
Shrubs, <i>&amp;c.</i> and let it be planted as near the <i>Pheasants
pearching Branch</i>, as may be. Place your Rods on the Ground, near the
Bush; which will help the Bush; for when some are taken below by the
Rods, they will scare up the others to get on the Bushes to seek what’s
become of their Fellows, and there become your Prey themselves. Thus
provided, keep close not to be discovered; out with your Call, and use
it <i>Skilfully</i> and well, and you need not fear Game. Number the
Rods you planted, and if any be missing, some <i>Pheasant</i> is crept
away with it, and here let your Spaniel be employed to serve you in
finding out the last sanctuary of the poor <i>Pheasant</i>, thus
shunning his inevitable Captivity and Death.</p>


<span class = "pagenum">83</span>
<h5 class = "ital">For taking Partridge.</h5>

<p>As in all the foregoing Sports, the <i>Place</i> where to find them
is our first Enquiry, so here (as you did of the <i>Pheasant</i>) you
must first find the <i>Partridges Haunt</i>. Which is mostly in
standing-Corn-Fields, where they breed; as likewise in Stubble after the
Corn is cut, especially Wheat-stubble till it is trodden, and then they
repair to Barley-Stubble, if fresh; and the Furrows amongst the Clots,
Brambles and long Grass, are sometimes their lurking places, for Twenty
and upward in a Covy. In the <i>Winter</i> in up-land Meadows, in the
dead Grass or Fog under Hedges, among Mole-Hills; or under the Roots of
Trees, <i>&amp;c.</i> Various and uncertain are their <i>Haunts</i>. And
tho some by the <i>Eye</i>, by distinguishing their Colour from the
ground, others by the <i>Ear</i>, by hearing the Cock call earnestly the
Hen, and the Hens answering, and chattering with Joy at meeting, do find
<i>Partridge</i>; yet the best, easiest and safest way of finding them
is (as you do the <i>Pheasant</i>) by
<span class = "pagenum">84</span>
the Call or Pipe; applying your Notes seasonable, as before prescribed,
and they will come near to you, and you may count their Numbers, and to
your sport.</p>

<p>Surround your Covy, prepare your Nets, and pricking a stick fast in
the ground, tye the one end to it, and let your Nets fall as you walk
briskly round without stopping, and cover the <i>Partridge</i>; then
rush in upon them to frighten them, and as they rise they are taken.</p>

<p>For taking them with <i>Bird-Lime</i>, thus. Call first near the
<i>Haunt</i>; if answered, stick about your <i>Lime-Straws</i> (of which
I have spoken before) a-cross in ranks two or three Lands, at some
distance from you; then call again, and as they approach you, they are
intercepted by the Straws; and to your Prey. This way is used most
successfully in Stubble-Fields, from <i>August</i> to <i>September</i>:
And Rods in Woods, Pastures, <i>&amp;c.</i> as for the
<i>Pheasant</i>.</p>

<p>But lastly, above all (to omit all others) the most pleasant way of
taking Partridge is with a <i>Setting-Dog</i> (of which I have spoken
before and refer you thither) who having set them, (known by
<span class = "pagenum">85</span>
the already mentioned signs) use your Net, as you have heard just now:
And by these Rules and Method, the <i>Railes</i>, <i>Quailes</i>,
<i>Moorpootes</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i> are to be taken; and are for
<i>Hawks</i> flight too. And here I must make an end of the most
material part of <i>Fowling</i>.</p>

<p>For as for treating of all manner of <i>Singing Birds</i>, their
<i>Taking</i>, which in general hath been before observed, their
<i>Preserving</i> and <i>Keeping</i>, their <i>Natural Breeding</i> and
<i>Feeding</i>, is a Work of such common Observation, and so differing
from the Design of this Treatise of <i>Violent</i> and <i>Brisk
Exercises</i>, that omitting it altogether here, shall refer you to the
Venders of them, whom you may meet with in every Street, and furnish
your self at easy rates; and are indeed but <i>Voces &amp; præterea
Nihil</i>.</p>

<p><span class = "firstletter">S</span>o <i>Ancient</i>, so
<i>Innocent</i>, so <i>Vertuous</i>, and so <i>Useful</i> is this
Recreation, that all the foregoing Divertisements, must needs give place
to this, and however (inadvertently) it comes in here, challenges a
Preference, and Acceptance before any Pleasure can by the heart of Man
be desired. As for its <i>Antiquity</i> some attribute its Knowledge to
<i>Belus</i> Son of <i>Nimrod</i>, who first invented all Vertuous
Sports; others to <i>Seth</i> and his Sons, he having left it on brazen
Pillars engraven with indelible Characters not to be obliterated by the
ensuing Flood. <i>Job</i> makes mention of Fishing, who Lived as may be
supposed before <i>Moses</i>; nor is it questionable, whether the
illustrious Patriarchs used not this Recreation. Certain it is, there
were many <i>Fishermen</i> before <i>Christs</i> Coming, whose sole
Dependance was on this Innocent Art. <i>Innocent</i> indeed and
harmless, when the Lamb of God himself <i>recommended</i> it (as I may
say) as such, by his Divine
<span class = "pagenum">87</span>
Call of four <i>Fishermen</i>, to be his Disciples, and by
distinguishing &amp; dignifying them with the greatest <i>Intimacy</i>
with himself, and chiefest place in the <i>Apostolical Catalogue</i>;
and by the Inspiration of his Spirit ennobled their Function; he made
them Eminent <i>Fishers of men</i>. Nay, at the expence of a
<i>Miracle</i>, he shewed the <i>Lawful Use</i> of Fishing, when the
mouth of <i>Peter’s</i> Fish he commanded him to take, was the
<i>Tribute-Money’s Purse</i>. And why our Saviour made his first
Election of Fishermen, before others, this may be the undoubted Reason:
Because he knew such men were naturally of more Contemplative and Serene
Minds, of more Calme, Peaceable, and sweet Dispositions; And let me add
too in the next place, because it is the School of Vertue (as I may call
it) wherein the Primitive Christian Vertues are learnt and exercised.
<i>Patience</i> is the immediate Vertue wherewith the <i>Angler</i> is
endued, without which the Pleasure doth no longer exist; and attended
with her three Sisters compleat his Delight. For <i>Justice</i> directs
him to the due Place of Sport, where he may freely exercise his Art,
without Injury or Incivility to his Neighbours: <i>Temperance</i>
prescribes a
<span class = "pagenum">88</span>
<i>Measure</i> to the Action, and moderates and rules the Affections.
And lastly <i>Fortitude</i> encourages and strengthens his mind, to
support the Labour and undergo with Perseverance all Disappointments,
excludes <i>Passion</i> (incident to other Recreations,) at the loss of
a Hook, or (perhaps that he never had) a&nbsp;Fish. It makes him not
fear Wind nor Weather, nor is his delight sowered at last with
<i>Melancholy</i> and Vexation; but tho the Anglers Reward is but a
little Fish, for a great deal of Pains, the Contentment and Satisfaction
is above that. Finally the <i>Usefulness</i> of it is apparently great;
for the cherishing the Body, and cheering the Mind, for diverting
Sadness, and calming unquiet Thoughts, for moderating Passions and
procuring Contentedness, and begetting Peace and Patience in those that
profess and practise it. It has been the Recreation of Gods Saints, and
Holy Fathers; and of many Worthy and Reverend Divines, this hath been
and is now their beloved Pastime. And so I shall conclude this
<i>Encomium</i> of Fishing; Volumes may be written in its praise (in
which I am something wanting in the other foregoing Sports, this
claiming it as its just due above the rest)
<span class = "pagenum">89</span>
but I long to tell you <i>How</i>, <i>When</i> and <i>Where</i>, you may
taste its Delight.</p>

<p class = "space">
It hath been the Method of this whole Treatise, to divide the several
distinct Heads of each Recreation into three Parts, to render the

Scene of Pastime, we now treat of, Fishing, so full of Variety and
Choice, I&nbsp;shall observe the same Method.</p>

<p class = "space">
First then, <i>What</i> we pursue is Fish, distinguished according to
their sundry kinds by these following <i>Names</i>.</p>

<p class = "hanging">
The <i>Barbel</i>, <i>Breame</i>, <i>Bleak</i>, <i>Bulhead</i>, or
Millers-Thumb; <i>Chevin</i>, <i>Char</i>, <i>Chub</i>, <i>Carp</i>;

<span class = "pagenum">90</span>
<i>Trout</i>, <i>Thwait</i>, and <i>Umber</i>. All these Alphabetically
thus named are the different sorts of Fish, in taking which the Angler
commonly exercises his Art. We come next, <i>Where</i> to find them.
</p>

<p class = "space">
I. To know the <i>Haunts</i> and Resorts of Fish, in which they are to
be usually found, is the most Material thing the Angler ought to be
instructed in, lest he vainly prepare <i>how to take</i> them, and
preposterously seek <i><ins class = "correction" title =
"‘w’ invisible">where</ins> to find</i> that he prepared for. To prevent
which you are first to understand, That as the Season of the Year is, so
<i>Fish</i> change their places: In <i>Summer</i>, some keep near the
Top, others the bottom of the Waters. In <i>Winter</i>, all <i>Fish</i>
in general resort to deep Waters. But more particularly,</p>

<p>The <i>Barbel</i>, <i>Roach</i>, <i>Dace</i>, and <i>Ruff</i>, covet
most <i>Sandy, Gravelly Ground</i>, the deepest part of the
<i>River</i>, and the Shadows of <i>Trees</i>.</p>

<p><i>Breame</i>, <i>Pike</i>, and <i>Chub</i>, delight in a
<i>Clay</i>, and <i>Ouzie Ground</i>: The <i>Bream</i> chooseth the
middle of the <i>River</i>, in a gentle not too rapid Stream: The
<i>Pike</i> prefereth still Waters, full of <i>Fry</i>, and absconding
himself amongst <i>Bull-Rushes</i>,
<span class = "pagenum">91</span>
<i>Water-docks</i>, or under <i>Bushes</i>, that under these shelters he
may more securely surprize and seize his Prey: The <i>Chub</i> too
chooses the same Ground, large Rivers and Streams, and is rarely
destitute of some Tree to cover and shade him.</p>

<p><i>Carp</i>, <i>Tench</i> and <i>Eel</i>, frequent foul muddy still
Waters. The <i><ins class = "correction" title =
"‘g’ invisible">greatest </ins> Eels</i> lurk under Stones, or Roots; the
<i>smallest</i> ones are found in all sorts of Rivers or Soyls: The
<i>Carp</i> is for the deepest stillest part of Pond or River, and so is
the <i>Tench</i>, and both delight in green Weeds.</p>

<p><i>Pearch</i> delighteth in gentle Streams of a reasonable Depth, not
too shallow; close by a Hollow Bank is their common Sanctuary.</p>

<p><i>Gudgeon</i> covets Sandy, Gravelly, Gentle Streams, and smaller
Rivers; not so much abounding in Brooks. He bites best in Spring, till
they spawn, and a little after till <i>Wasp</i> time.</p>

<p>The <i>Salmon</i> delights in large swift Rivers, which ebb and flow;
and are there plentifully to be found: As likewise Rocky and Weedy
Rivers. But in the latter end of the Year he is to be found high up in
the Country, in swift
<span class = "pagenum">92</span>
and violent Cataracts, coming thither to spawn.</p>

<p>The <i>Trout</i> loves small swift purling Brooks or Rivers, that run
upon Stones or Gravel, and in the swiftest deepest part of them, getteth
behind some Stone-Block and there feeds. He delights in a Point of a
River where the Water comes Whirling like the Eddy, to catch what the
Stream brings down, especially if he has the Shade of a Tree: He hugely
delights to lurk under some hollow Bank or Stone; seldom among
Weeds.</p>

<p><i>Shad</i>, <i>Thwait</i>, <i>Plaice</i>, <i>Peel</i>,
<i>Mullet</i>, <i>Suant</i> and <i>Flownder</i>, covet chiefly to be in
or near the Salt or Brackish Waters, which ebb and flow: The last,
<i>viz.</i> the <i>Flownder</i>, have been taken in fresh Rivers, as
coveting Sand and Gravel, deep gentle streams, near Banks,
<i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<p>Lastly the <i>Umber</i> affects Marly Clay Ground, clear and swift
Streams, far from the Sea; the greatest Plenty of these Fish is found in
<i>Derbyshire</i> and <i>Staffordshire</i>.</p>

<p>Thus much for the <i>Haunts</i> of Fish; I come next to know
<i>When</i> is the most <i>seasonable time</i> to catch them; which
before I speak to, let him that would become a
<span class = "pagenum">93</span>
compleat Angler, take this Rule. That he observe narrowly what Pond or
River soever he fisheth in, whether it be slimy, muddy, stoney or
gravelly; whether of a swift or slow Motion; As likewise that he know
the Nature of each Fish, and what Baits are most proper for every kind:
Not to let his Knowledg be circumscribed to one or two particular
Rivers, whither he is invited to Angle and take his Observations by the
Vicinity of his House; but to let his Knowledge be <i>general</i>, and
consequently his Sport will be so too. His Ignorance otherwise will
oblige him to be a Spectator in another River, when his Excellency is
confined to that only experienced one in or near his own Parish or
House. But to proceed,</p>

<p class = "space">
II. To understand the best <i>Time when</i> to Angle in, We must first
consider Affirmatively, when most <i>Seasonable</i>: Or,
2.&nbsp;Negatively, when <i>Unseasonable</i>.</p>

<p>1. <i>Seasonable</i> Angling is, When the Weather is calme, serene
and clear; tho the Cool cloudy Weather in Summer
<span class = "pagenum">94</span>
is to be preferred, provided the Wind blow not too boistrously, to
hinder your easy Guiding your Tools; In the hottest Months the cooler
the better.</p>

<p>2. When a Violent shower hath disturbed the Water and mudded it, then
with a <i>Red Worm</i>, Angle in the Stream at the ground.</p>

<p>3. A little before Fish spawn, when they repair to Gravely Fords to
rub and loosen their full Bellies; they bite freely.</p>

<p>4. From Sun-rising till eight of the Clock in the Morning, and from
four in the Afternoon till night for <i>Carp</i> and <i>Tench</i>. In
<i>June</i> and <i>July</i>, <i>Carps</i> shew themselves on the very
rim of the Water, then Fish with a <i>Lob-Worm</i>, as you would with a
Natural Flye. But be sure to keep out of sight.</p>

<p>5. In <i>March</i>, <i>April</i>, and <i>September</i>, and all
<i>VVinter</i>, when the Air is clear, serene and warm. And after a
showre of Rain, which hath only beaten the <i>Gnats</i>, and
<i>Flies</i> into the <i>River</i>, without muddying. The two first
mentioned Months with <i>May</i>, and part of <i>June</i>, are most
proper for the <i>Fly</i>; <i>Nine</i> in the Morning, and <i>Three</i>
a Clock in the
<span class = "pagenum">95</span>
Afternoon, is the best time; as likewise, when the <i>Gnats</i> play
much in a warm Evening.</p>

<p>6. In a <i>Cloudy</i>, and <i>VVindy</i> day, after a
<i>Moon-shine</i> clear Night, for the brightness of the Night (through
fear) making them abstain from feeding, and the Gloominess of the Day
emboldening and rendering them (through Hunger) sharp, and eager upon
food, they bite then freely.</p>

<p>7. <i>Lastly</i>, At the opening of <i>Mill-dams</i> or <ins class =
"correction" title = "‘l’ invisible"><i>Sluces</i></ins>, you will find
<i>Trouts</i>, &amp;c. come forth seeking food, brought down by the
Water. We come next to demonstrate the time not proper,
<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i></p>

<p>2. <i>Unseasonable</i> Angling in short is, When the Earth is
parched, and scorched with Vehement <i>Heat</i>, and <i>Drought</i>;
benummed and frozen with <i>Cold</i>, <i>Frost</i>, and <i>Snow</i>; or
refrigerated with Spring <i>Hoar-Frosts</i>; or blasted with the sharp,
bitter, nipping, <i>North</i>, or <i>East</i> Winds: Or when blustring
<i>Boreas</i> disorders your well guiding your Tackling; or the
<i>Sheep-Shearers Washings</i> glutted the <i>Fish</i>, and anticipated
your <i>Bait</i>; when the withdrawing of your sport, foretells a Storm,
and advises you to some shelter; or Lastly, when the night
<span class = "pagenum">96</span>
proves Dark, and Cloudy, you need not trouble your self the next day,
’tis to no purpose, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<p>Thus much shall suffice for the two first Parts I proposed to treat
of, <i>viz.</i> What we seek after in this Recreation, and Where, and
When to find it; I&nbsp;come next to speak of the several
<i>Implements</i>, and <i>Tackling</i> we ought to be provided with, for
the prosecuting the same; and then to our Sport.</p>

<p class = "space">
III. For providing <i>Stocks</i>, the best time is the Winter
<i>Solstice</i>, when the Sap is in the Roots of Trees, and their Leaves
gone. It is improper after <i>January</i>, the Sap then ascending into
the Trunk, and expanding it self over all the Branches. See that your
Stocks be <i>Taper-grown</i>, and your Tops of the best
<i>Ground-Hazle</i>, that can be had, smooth, slender, and straight, of
an Ell-long, pliant, and bending; and yet of a strength, that a
reasonable jerk cannot break it, but it will return to its first
straightness; lest otherwise you endanger your Line. Keep them two full
years, before you use them; having preserved them from Worm-eating, or
Rotting, by thrice a year rubbing
<span class = "pagenum">97</span>
<span class = "folionum">F</span>
and chaffing them well with Butter (if sweet) or Linsed or Sallet-Oyl;
and if Bored, Oyl poured into the Holes, and bathed four and twenty
houres in it, and then thrown out again, will exceedingly preserve
them.</p>

<p>But why should I further trouble my self with prescribing any Rules
for the ordering the Angle-Rod, since every Cane-shop in <i>London</i>
will furnish us at an easy rate, with Rods of Cane, that shall suit with
the sport we designe; the usual Objection of their <i>Colour</i> and
Stiffness being taken away, the first by covering it with Parchment or
thin Leather, dyed as you please; and the other by the length and
strength of the Top, being as before.</p>

<p>The next thing we come to prepare is the <i>Line</i>, which though
easy, yet admits of some Rule; wherefore to make it neat, handsome and
strong, twist the Hair you make it of <i>even</i>, having seen if the
Hair be of an equal bigness; then steep your Line in Water, to see if
the Hairs shrink, if so, you must twist them over again. The
<i>Colour</i> of the Hair is best of <i>Sorrel</i>, <i>White</i> and
<i>Grey</i>; Sorrel for muddy boggy Rivers, and the two last for clear
Waters.
<span class = "pagenum">98</span>
Nor is the <i>Pale watry green</i> contemptible, dyed thus: Take a pint
of strong <i>Ale</i>, half a pound of <i>Soot</i>, a&nbsp;little of the
Juice of <i>Walnut-Leaves</i> and <i>Allum</i>; Boyle these together in
a Pipkin half an hour, take it off, and when ’tis cold, put in your
Hair. In making your Line of Hair mix not Silk; but either all Hair, or
all Silk; as likewise distinguish the Line for the Ground Angle, and
that for the Fly-Rod, the last must be stronger than the first; in that
for the Artificial Fly, making the uppermost Link twenty Hairs long,
less in the next, and so less till you come to the Fly. Lastly at each
end of your Line make a Loop (called a <i>Bow</i>) the one
<i>Larger</i>, to fasten to, and take it from the top of your Rod, and
the other <i>Lesser</i> to hang your Hook-line&nbsp;on.</p>

<p>Your <i>Hook</i> comes next, and requires your Care, That it be Long
in the shank, something Round in compass, the point straight and even,
and bending in the shank. Set on your Hook with strong small Silk,
laying your Hair on the inside of the Hook.</p>

<p>Your <i>Flote</i> challenges divers wayes of making. Some using
<i>Muscovy</i> Duck-quills for still Waters. Others the
<span class = "pagenum">99</span>
<span class = "folionum">F2</span>
best sound Cork without flaws or holes, bored through with a hot Iron,
and a Quill of a fit proportion put into it; then pared into a pyramidal
Form, or in the fashion of a small Peare, to what bigness you please,
and ground smooth with a Grindstone or Pumice; this is best for strong
Streams.</p>

<p>In fine, <i>To plum the Ground</i>, get a <i>Carbine</i> Bullet bored
through, and in a strong twist hanged on your <i>Hook</i> or Rod. To
sharpen your <i>Hook</i>, carry <ins class = "correction" title =
"text reads ‘a / a’ at line break">a</ins> little <i>Whetstone</i>. To carry
your several Utensils without incommoding your Tackle, have several
<i>Partitions</i> of Parchment. And in short the Ingenious Angler will
not be unprovided of his <i>Bob</i> and <i>Palmer</i>; his <i>Boxes</i>
of all sizes for his <i>Hooks</i>, <i>Corks</i>, <i>Silk</i>,
<i>Thread</i>, <i>Flies</i>, <i>Lead</i>, &amp;c. His <i>Linnen</i> and
<i>Woollen Bait-Bags</i>; His splinted <i>Osier light Pannier</i>; And
lastly his <i>Landing Hook</i>, with a Screw at the end to screw it into
the socket of a Pole, &amp; stricken into the Fish, to draw it to Land:
To which socket, a&nbsp;Hook to cut up the Weeds, and another to pull
out Wood, may be fastned.</p>

<p>But all those Implements I have described, serve to no purpose, if we
do not observe to have the <i>Agents</i> and
<span class = "pagenum">100</span>
Effecters of our Pastime in store, I&nbsp;mean proper <i>Baits</i> and
Inticements to take your Fish. Which branch themselves into three
Kinds.</p>

<p>First, The <i>Life-baits</i>, which are all kind of <i>Worms</i>,
<i>Redworm</i>, <i>Maggot</i>, <i>Dors</i>, <i>Froggs</i>, <i>Bobb</i>,
<i>Brown-Flies</i>, <i>Grashoppers</i>, <i>Hornets</i>, <i>Wasps</i>,
<i>Bees</i>, <i>Snails</i>, small <i>Roaches</i>, <i>Bleak</i>,
<i>Gudgeon</i>, or <i>Loaches</i>.</p>

<p>Secondly, <i>Artificial living Baits</i>, of <i>Flyes</i> of all
sorts and shapes, made about your Hooks with Silk and Feathers, at all
times seasonable, especially in blustering Weather.</p>

<p>Lastly, <i>Dead Baits</i>, Pasts of all maings, Wasps dryed or
undryed, clotted <i>Sheeps-blood</i>, <i>Cheese</i>,
<i>Bramble-berries</i>, <i>Corn</i>, <i>Seeds</i>, <i>Cherries</i>,
&amp;c. The two first good in <i>May</i>, <i>June</i> and <i>July</i>,
the two next in <i>April</i>; and the last in the <i>Fall</i> of the
Leaf.</p>


<h5 class = "ital">
Of Flies.</h5>

<p>Of <i>Natural</i> Flies there are innumerable, and therefore it
cannot be expected I can particularize all; but some of their Names I
shall nominate, <i>viz.</i> The <i>Dun-Fly</i>, <i>Red-Fly</i>,
<i>May-Fly</i>, <i>Tawny-Fly</i>, <i>Moor-Fly</i>, <i>Shell-Fly</i>,
<i>Flag-Fly</i>, <i>Vine-Fly</i>,
<span class = "pagenum">101</span>
<span class = "folionum">F3</span>
<i>Cloudy</i> or <i>Blackish-Fly</i>, <i>Canker-Flies</i>,
<i>Bear-Flies</i>, <i>Caterpillars</i>, and thousands more, differing
according to the Soiles, Rivers or Plants.</p>

<p><i>Artificial Flies</i>, are made by the ingenious Angler, according
to Art, in shape, colour and proportion like the Natural Fly, of
<i>Fur</i>, <i>Wool</i>, <i>Silk</i>, <i>Feathers</i>, &amp;c. To
delineate which I must confess my self not so accurate and skilful a
Painter, nor can any Pen-drawing illustrate their Various Colours so, as
to direct their Artificial Counterfeit; Nature will help him in this by
Observation, curiously <ins class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘Flourishng’">Flourishing</ins> their several Orient and bright Colours,
after which they take their names, as before said: And therefore to
furnish your self with both Natural and Artificial <i>Flyes</i>, repair
in the morning to the River, and with a Rod beat the Bushes that hang
over the Water, and take your Choice; This is a Rule whereby you may
know by their Number what <i>Fly</i> the Fish affect most, and
accordingly to use it; taking with you these following Directions.</p>

<p>1. Observe to Angle with the Artificial <i>Fly</i> in Rivers
disturbed somewhat by Rain, or in a Cloudy day, the
<span class = "pagenum">102</span>
Wind blowing gently: If the Wind be not so high, but you may well guide
your Tackle, in plain Deeps is to be found the best Fish, and best
Sport: If small Wind breeze, in swift streams is best Angling: Be sure
to keep your <i>Fly</i> in perpetual slow motion; and observe that the
Weather suit the Colour of your <i>Fly</i>, as the light Colour’d in a
Clear day, the Darkish in a dark, <i>&amp;c.</i> As likewise according
to the Waters Complexions, have your Fly suitable.</p>

<p>2. Let your Line be twice as long as your Rod: Keep as far as you can
from the Waterside, the Sun on your back; In casting your Fly, let that
fall first; your Line not touching the Water.</p>

<p>3. Have a nimble Eye, and active quick Hand to strike presently upon
the rising of the Fish, lest finding his mistake he spew out the
Hook.</p>

<p>4. In slow Rivers cast your Fly cross them, let it sink a little,
draw it back gently, without breaking or circling <ins class =
"correction" title = "text reads ‘the / the’ at line break">the</ins>
Water; let the Fly float with the Current, and you will not fail of
excellent Sport.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">103</span>
<span class = "folionum">F4</span>
<p>5. Observe to let the Wings of your <i>Salmon-Flys</i> to be one
behind another, whether two or four, and they and the Tail long, and of
the finest gaudiest Colours you can choose.</p>

<p><i>Lastly</i>, In clear Rivers a small <i>Fly</i> with slender Wings
is best, and in muddied Rivers a Fly of a more than Ordinary large
Body.</p>

<p class = "space">
Thus much for Flies, I come next to that I called <i>Dead-Baits</i>, and
shall begin with the several Wayes of making Pastes.</p>


<h5 class = "ital">
Of Pastes.</h5>

<p>1. Beat in a Mortar the Leg of a young <i>Coney</i> (Vulgarly called
the <i>Almond</i>) or of a Whelp or Catling, and a quantity of Virgins
Wax and <i>Sheeps</i> suet, till they are incorporated, and temper them
with clarified <i>Honey</i> into Paste.</p>

<p>2. <i>Sheeps</i> Blood, <i>Cheese</i>, fine <i>Manchet</i> and
clarified <i>Honey</i> tempered as before.</p>

<p>3. <i>Sheeps</i>-Kidney-Suet, <i>Cheese</i>, fine Flower, with
clarified <i>Honey</i> tempered.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">104</span>
<p>4. <i>Cherries</i>, <i>Sheeps</i> Blood, <i>Saffron</i> and fine
<i>Manchet</i> made into a Paste.</p>

<p>5. Beat into a Paste; the fattest Old <i>Cheese</i>, the strongest
<i>Rennet</i> can be got, fine <i>Wheat-flower</i> and <i>Annis-seed</i>
Water: If for a <i>Chub</i> you make the Paste, put a little rafty
<i>Bacon</i>.</p>

<p>Lastly, <i>Mutton</i>-Kidney Suet, and <i>Turmerick</i> reduced to a
fine Powder, the fattest old <i>Cheese</i> and strongest <i>Rennet</i>,
wrought to a Paste, adding <i>Turmerick</i>, till the Paste be of a
curious Yellow; and is excellent and approved for <i>Chevin</i>.</p>

<p>All which Pastes when you use them, that you may have the desired
Effects of your Pains infallibly follow, anoint your Bait with this
Confection: Take the Oyl of <i>Aspray</i>, <i>Coculus India</i>, and
<i>Assa <ins class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘Fætida’">Fœtida</ins></i> beaten, and mix with it as much
Life-<i>Honey</i>; then dissolve them in the Oyle of <i>Polypody</i>,
and keep it in a close Glass for your use. And that your Paste may not
wash off your Hook, beat Cotten-Wool or Flax into&nbsp;it.</p>


<span class = "pagenum">105</span>
<span class = "folionum">F5</span>
<h5 class = "ital">
Of keeping Baits.</h5>

<p>For the keeping and preserving all quick Baits, you must keep them
separately as they are several, not altogether; and feed them with that
they most delight in; as for instance, in short:</p>

<p>The <i>Red-Worm</i>, must be kept in a bag of Red Cloth, with a
handful of chopt <i>Fennel</i>, mixt with half so much fresh, black and
fertile Mould, will scoure and preserve them: All other Worms, with the
Leaves of Trees they are bred on, renewing them often in a day. Only the
<i>Cad-bait</i>, <i>Bob</i> and <i>Canker</i>, &amp;c. must be kept in
the same things you find them.</p>

<p>The great <i>White Maggots</i>, keep them in Sheeps-Tallow, or little
bits of a beasts Liver; and to scoure them, hang them warm in a bag of
Blanketing with Sand.</p>

<p>The <i>Frogs and Grasshoppers</i>, in wet Moss and long Grass,
frequently moistned; and when used, the Legs of the first, and the Wings
of the other must be cut close off.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">106</span>
<p>The <i>Flies</i> use them as you take them. Only the <i>Wasps</i>,
<i>Hornets</i> and <i>Humble-Bee</i>, must be dryed in an Oven, their
heads dipt in Sheeps blood, and dryed again, may be kept in a Box for
use.</p>

<p>Thus much shall suffice for the Anglers Tools and Baits, I&nbsp;shall
now lead him to his Sport, having first Clad himself with all inward and
outward Ornaments.</p>

<p><i>Inward</i>, In having his Mind cloathed with these Qualifications,
<i>viz.</i></p>

<p>1. <i>Learning</i>, throughly to understand his Art, and skilfully
argue and dispute its Excellency, <i>&amp;c<ins class = "correction"
title = ", for .">. </ins></i></p>

<p>2. <i>Faith</i>, to enjoy the Benefit of his Expectation.</p>

<p>3. <i>Love</i>, to his Pleasure, not thinking it irksom and tedious,
to his Neighbour, in not offending him.</p>

<p>4. <i>Patience</i>, In not excruciating himself for Accidents of
Losses, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<p>5. <i>Humility</i>, in wetting himself, lying down, kneeling,
<i>&amp;c.</i> as Occasion requires.</p>

<p>6. <i>Liberality</i>, in dispencing to others the Fruits of his
Labour.</p>

<p><i>Outward</i>, In cloathing his body with plain and comely Apparel,
of sad dark
<span class = "pagenum">107</span>
Colours, as sad grayes, tawny, purple, hair or Musk Colour. Warm <ins
class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘and / and’ at line break">and</ins> well lined, to prevent the Evils which the Coldness of
the Air, or Moistness of the Water may produce.</p>

<p>And now thus equipt let us walk to the Rivers side, there give me
leave to direct you in the <i>Measures</i> you must take and observe,
for the obtaining the End of what all our forementioned Preparations
aime at; I&nbsp;mean the Catching those sundry kinds of Fish I
enumerated at the begining of this Discourse; and observing that first
method, I&nbsp;shall Alphabetically describe, what Baits are most Proper
for taking them, and How to use them.</p>

<p>To begin then with the <i>Barbel</i>. The best time for Angling for
this Fish is at the latter end of <i>May</i>, <i>June</i>, <i>July</i>,
and beginning of <i>August</i>, in his Haunts aforementioned; and the
best Bait (omiting others) is the well-scoured <i>Lob-Worm</i> (being of
a curious cleanly Palate as well as shape) or Cheese steept an hour or
two in clarified Honey. He is a subtile Fish, extraordinary strong, and
dogged to be dealt with, and therefore be sure to have your Rod and Line
strong and
<span class = "pagenum">108</span>
long, or you may endanger to break&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>The <i>Breame</i> is next in order; The most seasonable time to Angle
for him is from St. <i>James</i> tide till <i>Bartholomew</i> tide. He
spawneth in <i>June</i> or begining of <i>July</i>; is easily taken, as
falling on his side after one or two gentle turnes, and so drawn easily
to Land. The best Bait for him is that (most delightful to him)
<i>Red-Worme</i> (found in Commons &amp; <i>Chalky</i> Grounds after
Rain) at the root of a great <i>Dock</i>, wrapt up in a round Clue. He
loves also Paste, Flag-Wormes, Wasps, Green-Flies, Butter-Flies, and a
Grass-hopper, without Leggs.</p>

<p>Bait your Ground the night before with gross-ground Malt, boiled and
strained, and then in the morning with the Red-Worm, bait your Hook, and
plumbing your Ground within half an Inch, Fish.</p>

<p>The <i>Bleak</i>, an eager Fish, is caught with all sorts of Worms
bred on Trees or Herbs, also with <i>Flies</i>, <i>Cad-bait</i>,
<i>Bobs</i>, <i>Paste</i>, <i>Sheeps-Blood</i>, <i>White Snails</i>,
<i>Wasps</i>, <i>Gnats</i>, &amp;c. In a warm clear day the small Flye
at the rim of the Water
<span class = "pagenum">109</span>
is best; In a Cloudy day, <i>Gentles</i> or <i>Cadis</i> two foot under
the Water.</p>

<p>The <i>Bull-head</i> or <i>Millers-thumb</i>, being Childrens
Recreation, I&nbsp;shall speak little of, only being serviceable for
Baits, I&nbsp;shall only say he is easily taken with a small Worm, being
lazie and simple, and will swallow any thing; and the <i>Minnow</i>,
<i>Loach</i>, and <i>Bansticle</i> being of the same diet, I&nbsp;place
here too.</p>

<p>The <i>Chevin</i>, loveth all sorts of <i>Worms</i>, <i>Flies</i>,
<i>Cheese</i>, <i>Grain</i>, and <i>Black Worms</i>, their Bellies being
slit, that the White may be seen: And very much delighteth in the
<i>Pith</i> of an <i>Oxes back</i>, the tough outward skin being
carefully taken off, without breaking the inward tender skin. In the
Morning early angle for <i>Chevin</i>, with a <i>Snail</i>; in the heat
of the day, with some other Bait; in the afternoon with the <i>Fly</i>;
the great <i>Moth</i>, with a great Head, yellow Body, and whiteish
Wings, usually found in <i>Gardens</i>, about the Evening: The larger
the <i>Chevin</i>, the sooner taken; loving his Bait large, and variety
on a Hook.</p>

<p>The <i>Char</i> is a <i>Lancashire Fish</i>, found in a <i>Mere</i>,
called <i>Winander-Mere</i> in that <i>County</i>, the largest in
<i>England</i>; and being
<span class = "pagenum">110</span>
to be found no where else, I&nbsp;shall not lead my <i>London</i> Angler
thither to teach him to take&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>The <i>Chub</i>, called by some a <i>Cheven</i>, by others a
<i>Villain</i>, is a <i>Fish</i> of no rare Meat; however, is good for a
young Angler, and is thus to be taken: Bait your hook with a
<i>Grass-hopper</i>, find the Hole where he lies, accompanied in a hot
day, with twenty or more, floating almost on the very superficies of the
Water; choose which you think best, and fairest, and drop your Hook some
two foot before him, and he will bite at it greedily, and cannot break
hold with his <i>Leather Mouth</i>; let him play and tire, lest you
break your Line. If you cannot get a <i>Grass-hopper</i>, then any
<i>Worm</i>, or <i>Fly</i> you will. In cold Weather, fish for him near
the Bottom, and the <i>Humble-Bee</i> is the best Bait. Some appropriate
Baits according to the Month, but I shall Omit that; The <i>Chub</i>
(being best and in his Prime in the Winter, and then excellent meat
Baked) a&nbsp;Paste made of <i>Cheese</i>, and <i>Turpentine</i>, is the
only Bait to take him.</p>

<p>The <i>Carp</i> is subtle, and full of Policy, will never bite in
Cold Weather,
<span class = "pagenum">111</span>
but in Hot you cannot be too Early, or too Late. In <i>March</i>, he
seldome refuseth the <i>Red-Worme</i>, in <i>June</i> the <i>Cadice</i>,
and the three next <i>Months</i> the <i>Grass-hopper</i>: Pastes that
are sweet, of which I have spoken before, are very delightfull to
<i>Carps</i>: And especially; if you Bait your ground two or three dayes
before you angle, with <i>Pellets</i> of course Paste,
<i>Chickens-guts</i>, <i>Garbage</i>, &amp;c. <i>Gentles</i> anointed,
and a Piece of <i>Scarlet</i> dipt in <i>Honey</i>, put them on the
Hook, is an approved way.</p>

<p>The <i>Dace</i>, <i>Dare</i>, <i>Rudd</i>, and <i>Roach</i>, being
much of a kind, and feeding, I&nbsp;shall put together, and are easily
taken with small <i>Worms</i>, <i>Bobs</i>, <i>Cadbaits</i>,
<i>Flies</i>, <i>sheeps-Blood</i>, all sorts of <i>Worms</i>, bred on
<i>Trees</i> or <i>Herbs</i>, <i>Paste</i>, <i>Wasps</i>, <i>Gnats</i>,
<i>Lipberries</i>, &amp;c. The Heads of the <i>Wasps</i>, being dipt in
Blood, is good for <i>Dace</i>, and <i>Dare</i>; as is likewise the
<i>Ant-flie</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Eel</i>, takes great <i>Red-worms</i>, <i>Beef</i>,
<i>Wasps</i>, <i>Guts</i> of <i>Fowl</i>, or <i>Fish</i>, <i>Menow</i>,
small <i>Roaches</i> are good Bait for Night Hooks; the Hooks being in
the Mouth of the <i>Fish</i>. Now because this is very delightfull to
most, I&nbsp;shall prescribe three wayes of taking them, as are most
<span class = "pagenum">112</span>
full of Pleasure. The first way is called, <i>Sniggling</i>, or
<i>Broggling</i> for <i>Eels</i>, thus: Take a strong Line and Hook,
baited with a <i>Lob</i>, or <i>Garden-Worm</i>, and observing where
<i>Eels</i> lurk in the day time, with a stick forked at the Top, gently
put your Bait into the Hole, and if there be any <i>Eels</i> there, you
will not fail of a Bite, of as large <i>Eels</i> as can be had, but pull
not too hard lest you spoyl all. The second is called <i>Bobbing</i>,
which is thus done: Take some large well scowred <i>Lobs</i>, and with a
Needle, run some strong twisted <i>Silk</i> through them, from end to
end, so many as are enough to wrap about a Board near a dozen times; tye
them fast with the two ends of the <i>Silk</i> to hang in so many Hanks;
then fasten all to a strong Cord, and a handfull above the <i>Worms</i>
fasten a <i>Plumb</i> of three quarters of a pound, and your Cord to a
strong <i>Pole</i>, and in muddy Waters, you may <i>Fish</i>, and find
the <i>Eels</i> tug lustily, and when you think they have swallowed
them, draw up your Line, and a-shore with them. <i>Lastly</i>, the
<i>Eel-Spear</i> made with four Teeth, jagged on both sides, stricken
into the Mud, on the bottom of a River, and if you chance to strike
<span class = "pagenum">113</span>
where they lye, you infallibly take.</p>

<p>There is likewise an assured way of taking <i>Eels</i>, approved to
excel any other, thus done: Take some Bottles of <i>Hay</i>, mixt with
green <i>Osiers</i>, or <i>Willows</i>, Bait them with <i>Sheeps
Guts</i>, or other <i>Beasts Garbage</i>, sink them down in the middle,
to the bottom of your <i>Pond</i>, or by the <i>Bank-sides</i>, having
fastned a Cord to the Bottles, that you may twitch them up at your
pleasure, and all the best <i>Eels</i> will resort to them, and you may
take abundance.</p>

<p>The <i>Flounder</i>, <i>Shad</i>, <i>Thwait</i>, <i>Suant</i>, and
<i>Mullet</i>, are taken with <i>Red-Worms</i> of all sorts,
<i>Wasps</i>, and <i>Gentles</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Grayling</i> is next; In <i>Angling</i> for which, you must
head your Hook upon the shank, with a very slender and narrow plate of
<i>Lead</i>, that the Bait (a&nbsp;large <i>Grass-hopper</i>) may the
more easily come over it; and at the point put a <i>Cadbait</i>, and
keep the Bait in continual motion; not forgetting to pull off the
<i>Grass-hoppers</i> Wings.</p>

<p>The <i>Gudgeon</i>, takes the smallest <i>Red-Worm</i>, <i>Wasps</i>,
<i>Gentles</i>, and <i>Cadbaits</i>. When you <i>Fish</i> for him, stir
up the <i>Sand</i> or <i>Gravel</i> with a <i>Pole</i>, which will make
them gather thither, and bite more eagerly.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">114</span>
<p>The <i>Guiniad</i>, I shall remit speaking to, only mentioning it in
course, being no where found, but in a place called, <i>Pemble-Mere</i>,
in which place they abound, as the River <i>Dee</i> does with
<i>Salmon</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Pope</i>, or <i>Ruff</i>, is excellent for a young
<i>Angler</i>, bites greedily, and quantities may be taken, by Baiting
the Ground with <i>Earth</i>, and your Hook with small Red
<i>Worms</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Pike</i>, loveth all sorts of Baits (unless the <i>Fly</i>)
<i>Gudgeon</i>, <i>Dace</i>, <i>Roaches</i> and <i>Loaches</i>; and
young <i>Frogs</i> in <i>Summer</i> time, of which the yellowest is
best.</p>

<p>The <i>Pearch</i>, taketh all sorts of <i>Earth-worms</i>, especially
the <i>Lob-worm</i>, and <i>Brandling</i>, well scowred, <i>Bobs</i>,
<i>Oak-worms</i>, <i>Dors</i>, <i>Gentles</i>, <i>Cole-wort-worms</i>,
<i>Wasps</i>, <i>Cadbaits</i>, and <i>Menow</i>, or a little
<i>Frog</i>, the Hook being fastned through the skin of his Leg, towards
the upper part of it. Be sure you give the <i>Pearch</i> time enough to
pouch his Bait, before you strike.</p>

<p>The <i>Salmon</i>, is taken best with <i>Lob-worms</i>, scented with
the Oyl of <i>Ivy-berries</i>, or the Oyl of <i>Polypody</i> of the
<i>Oak</i> mixt with <i>Turpentine</i>: Or the well-scowred
<i>Garden-worm</i>, is an excellent
<span class = "pagenum">115</span>
Bait: The <i>Salmon</i> bites best in <i>May</i>, <i>June</i>, and
<i>July</i>, at three a <i>Clock</i> in the Afternoon, if the Water be
clear, a&nbsp;little Wind stirring, especially near the <i>Sea</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Tench</i>, is a great lover of large Red <i>Worms</i>, first
dipt in <i>Tar</i>. As also all sorts of Paste, made up with strong
scented <i>Oyls</i>, or <i>Tar</i>, or a Paste made up of Brown
<i>Bread</i>, and <i>Honey</i>. He will bite too at a <i>Cad-worm</i>,
<i>Lob-worm</i>, <i>Flag-worm</i>, green <i>Gentle</i>, <i>Cadbait</i>,
<i>Marsh-worm</i>, or soft boil’d <i>Bread-grain</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Torcoth</i>, being before mentioned, I only let you know, that
he is only found, in the Pool <i>Linperis</i> in <i>Carnarvan-shire</i>;
and leave you to the <i>Welch-mens</i> description, both of him and his
<i>Bait</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Trout</i>, is fattest, and in his prime in <i>May</i>, and is
caught with all sorts of <i>Worms</i>, especially <i>Brandlings</i>,
commonly found in an Old <i>Dung-hill</i>, <i>Cow-dung</i>,
<i>Hors-dung</i>, or <i>Tanners-bark</i>: Also with <i>Flies</i>,
Natural and Artificial, with young <i>Frogs</i>, <i>Menow</i>,
<i>Marsh</i>, <i>Dock</i> or <i>Flag-worms</i>; all sorts of
<i>Cad-bait</i>, <i>Dors</i>, <i>Bobs</i>, <i>Palmers</i>,
<i>Gentles</i>, <i>Wasps</i>, <i>Hornets</i>, &amp;c. and with the
<i>Catterpiller</i>, used according to the Rule before prescribed for
the <i>Grayling</i>.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">116</span>
<p><i>Lastly</i>, The <i>Umber</i>, endeth our <i>Alphabet</i>, and
<i>Discourse</i> of <i>Fishing</i> too, and gives me occasion to add no
more, but that he is taken as the <i>Trout</i>, just now mentioned; And
therefore now to your Sport: To assist your well effecting which,
I&nbsp;have but this to add; Cast into your Haunts where you use to
<i>Fish</i>, once in four or five dayes, soft boyled <i>Corn</i> (or
oftner for <i>Carp</i>, and <i>Tench</i>) Also <i>Garbage</i>, <i>Beasts
Livers</i>, chopt <i>Worms</i>, <i>Grains</i> steept in <i>Blood</i>, to
attract them to the place; and to keep them together, throw in half a
handfull of <i>Grains</i> of ground <i>Malt</i>: But in a stream, cast
it above your Hook, that floating towards you may draw the Fish
thither.</p>

<p>Before I conclude, I was afraid this discourse would have been
imperfect, had not something been spoken of <i>Fish-ponds</i>, their
Ordering, and Improving, that the private Gentleman may not be destitute
of some appropriated place to himself, wherein he may Recreate himself
in this excellent Pastime; great <i>Rivers</i> belonging either to the
King, or to Lords of Mannours, whose Authorities and Jurisdictions must
be kept inviolate, and excludes our Intrusion there.</p>


<span class = "pagenum">117</span>
<h5 class = "ital">
Of Fish-ponds.</h5>

<p>When you have a desire to dig a <i>Fish-pond</i>, coveting the
several Advantages that do thence accrue to you, you must first of all
consult, what <i>Grounds</i> are most fit and proper to be cast into a
Pond, <i>viz</i>, Those which are <i>Marrishy</i>; or <i>Boggy</i>; or
full of <i>Springs</i>, unfit for <i>Grazing</i>, or to be put to any
profitable use besides. Of these the last, full of <i>springs</i>, will
yield the best Water; that which is <i>Marshy</i> will feed Fish; and
that which is <i>Boggy</i> is best for a Defence against Thieves.</p>

<p>Thus being furnished with a piece of Wast Ground, I now mentioned,
let us now to work; And first draw by small Trenches all the Springs or
moist Veines into one place, and so drain the rest of the Ground; then
mark out the Head of your Pond, and make it the highest part of the
ground in the Eye, tho it be the lowest in the true Level: Cut the
Trench of your <i>Floodgate</i> so, that when the VVater is let out, it
may have a swift Fall: On each side of which Trench drive in great
Stakes of <i>Oak</i>, <i>Ash</i> or (which is
<span class = "pagenum">118</span>
best) <i>Elme</i>, six foot long, and six Inches square; place these in
Rowes four foot distance one from another, as broad and wide from the
<i>Floodgate</i> as you intend the Head of your Pond shall go: Now give
us the Spade <i>Tom</i>, and fetch us the Pick-ax <i>Jack</i>, and to
digging of our Pond; Dig it as big and large a Compass as the Ground
will permit, throw your Earth amongst the said stakes, and ram it
between them, hard and firm, till you have covered the stakes: Drive in
as many new ones more besides the heads of the first stakes, and ram
more Earth above them too: Do thus with stakes above stakes till the
head-sides be of a convenient Height: Taking care, that the inside of
your Banks be smooth, even, hard and strong, that you may not fear the
wearing of the Earth off the stakes by any Current of the Water.</p>

<p>Having thus digged about <i>eight foot deep</i>, that so it may carry
about <i>six foot</i> VVater, pave all the <i>bottom</i> and the Banks
of the Pond with large Sods of <i>Flot-Grass</i>, laying them very close
together, pin them down fast with small stakes and windings: This Grass
is a great Feeder of Fish, and grows naturally
<span class = "pagenum">119</span>
under VVater. Stake down to the bottom of one side of the Pond divers
Bavens and Brush-VVood-Faggots, into which the Fish may cast their
spawn, and preserve it: In another place lay Sods upon Sods, the grass
sides together to nourish and breed <i>Eels</i>.</p>

<p>The Pond being thus made, let in the Water, and now observe to store
it thus: Put your <i>Carp</i>, <i>Breame</i> and <i>Tench</i> by
themselves: <i>Pike</i>, <i>Pearch</i>, <i>Eel</i> and <i>Tench</i> (the
Fishes Physician) by themselves; &amp; for Food of the greater Fishes,
as well as Meat for your greater Dishes, put good store of <i>Roach</i>,
<i>Dace</i>, <i>Loach</i> and <i>Menow</i>; and Lastly to every one
<i>Melter</i> put three <i>Spawners</i>, and in three Years the Increase
will be great; and in five Years with difficulty destroyed.</p>

<p>At the end of three Years <i>Sue your Pond</i>; which you must ever
continue so to do, for that the <i>Roach</i>, &amp;c. will increase in
such abundance, that eating up the sweetest food, will make your other
Fish, as <i>Carps</i>, &amp;c. be lean and hunger-starved: And therefore
every Year view your Pond, and observe if any such Fry appears; and use
your Discretion.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">120</span>
<p>And because the <i>Carp</i> is a Fish of a general Acceptation, and
is of a <i>bon goust</i> almost in every mans palate; and being by the
aforesaid little Devourers and Multiplyers, very often Deceived in your
expectation of a fat <i>Carp</i>, large and sweet; I&nbsp;shall insert
here an excellent VVay of making <i>Carps</i> grow to an extraordinary
Bigness in a Pond.</p>


<h5 class = "ital">
To make <em>Carps</em> grow large, <em>&amp;c.</em></h5>

<p>About the Month of <i>April</i>, when you perceive your Pond grow low
in VVater, rake all the sides where the VVater is fallen away with an
Iron Rake, and sow <i>Hay-seeds</i> there, and rake it well; and at the
Latter end of Summer you shall have good store of Grass: The
<i>Winter</i> being come the VVater will encrease and over-top all the
Grass, and there being VVater enough to carry them, the <i>Carps</i>
will resort to the seeds, and feed briskly and grow as fat as
<i>Hoggs</i>: Thus do every <i>Summer</i>, till you sue your pond, and
no River <i>Carp</i> can surpass them.</p>

<p>Thus much of <i>Fishing</i> and <i>Fish-Ponds</i>.</p>

<p><span class = "firstletter">T</span>he Use of the Bow is of so great
Antiquity, and of so important a Consequence for a <i>defensive</i> and
<i>offensive Armes</i>, that I could not but a little consider, how
needful the true knowledge of its Use was esteemed of Old, and how
<i>little it is accounted</i> now. It is uncertain, as well as (almost)
unknown, who was the First Inventor of the Bow; but if we examine the
<i>Probability</i> there may be of its being derived from the Tyranical
Government of <i>Nimrod</i>, that so <i>Mighty Hunter before the
Lord</i>, we may <i>Conjecture</i> him to be the first Inventor of the
Bow: For as he is called the <i>First Founder</i> of a <i>Monarchick
Government</i>, by reducing and subduing a disordered People under the
Government of himself; so was he likewise esteemed a <i>Mighty
Hunter</i> in another respect, for that he <i>Subdued likewise the
Beasts of the Field</i>; as is observed of him and his Character, by
sundry Commentators on him and his Family. So that in the whole we may
<span class = "pagenum">122</span>
suppose him to be the Inventor, or first Finder out of the Bow, as a
Weapon of an infallible Execution and mortal Efficacy on that account.
Nor can I find any mention made of the <i>Bow</i> thro the whole Hystory
of <i>Genesis</i> from <i>Nimrod</i> to <i>Esau</i>, they both being
characterized with those Epithets of <i>Mighty and Cunning Hunters</i>,
<i>Men of the Field</i>; who very well understood the Use of the Bow, as
well for their <i>Profit</i> as <i>Pleasure</i>; the last of which is
particularly hinted in the commands of <i>Isaac</i> to <i>Esau</i>, that
with his <i>Quiver</i> and his <i>Bow</i>, he should Hunt and take that
only <i>Seasonable</i> Dish, which might procure and entaile a
<i>Blessing</i> on him and his Posterity. Nay, that Holy Patriarch
<i>Jacob</i> himself, in his last Will and Testament to his Illustrious
Family, bequeaths a <i>singular Portion</i> to his beloved
<i>Joseph</i>, which the <i>strength of his Bow</i> had intitled him to.
<i>Gen.</i> 48.&nbsp;22.</p>

<p>Nor are we to doubt in what Estimation it was held to the Reign of
<i>David</i> King of <i>Israel</i>, who thought it the most <i>Necessary
Qualification</i> of his Subjects, to be very well versed in the Use of
the <i>Bow</i>. The <i>Bow</i> which was the Famous <i>Signal</i>
between his beloved
<span class = "pagenum">123</span>
<span class = "folionum">G2</span>
<i>Jonathan</i> and himself, and made the private <i>Testimonial</i> of
the undeserv’d Fury of his Maliciously &amp; Enviously incensed
<i>Father Saul</i>: By reason of whose eminent Skill, in the expert use
of it, he chants forth his <i>Mournful Elegy</i>, The <i>Bow of
<em>Jonathan</em> returned not empty, from the Blood of the slain</i>,
&amp;c. Nay further so useful (no doubt) he thought the Knowledge of the
Bow was, and of so necessary a Consequence for a Defensive as well as
Offensive Armes, that it is observable he issued out a particular Edict
or Proclamation, commanding the <i>general Learning its use
throughout</i> Judah. And the Use of it continued and still does in the
East, as the only Weapon they are skilled&nbsp;in.</p>

<p>Dr. <i>Heylin</i> in his Cosmographical Description of the World,
tells us, That the <i>Czeremissi</i>, a&nbsp;People living in great
Forrests, without Houses, feeding on Honey &amp; the Flesh of Wild
Beasts &amp; Clothed with their Skins, under the Empire of the
<i>Czar</i> of <i>Russia</i>, are such excellent Archers, and so light
of Foot, that they carry their Bows continually in their hands, and
practise their Children so timely in it, that (after such an age) till
they can hit a <i>White</i>
<span class = "pagenum">124</span>
that is set before them, they give them nothing to eat.</p>

<p>Further; it is recorded of the <i>Parthians</i> (and indeed all the
<i>Persians</i> too) that their greatest Fame consisted in their skilful
handling their <i>Bows</i> and <i>Arrows</i>, &amp; were deservedly
reckon’d the best Archers in the World, having the Art of <i>Shooting
backwards</i>, and making their <i>Retreat</i> and <i>Flight</i> more
pernicious and terrible, than their <i>Charge</i> and <i>Onset</i>. So
that when <i>Marcus Crassus</i> in his expedition against them, was told
by an <i>Astrologer</i>, that having found an ill Aspect in
<i>Scorpio</i>, he presaged his Enterprize would prove unsuccesseful,
<i>Tush Man</i> (quoth he) <i>I fear not Scorpio, but
Sagittarius</i>.</p>

<p>And to descend to our own Countrymen the English, the frequent
Victories they obtained over the <i>French</i> formerly, rendred them as
famous and able Bow-men (next the <i>Parthians</i>) as were in the
World.</p>

<p>But since the Ingenious <i>Franciscan</i> Fryer (<i>Bertholdus
Swart</i>) appeared in <i>Germany</i>, his <i>Sulphureous</i> Brain has
quite (or almost) <i>blown</i> up the Reputation of the Bow, and all
other Ancient Devices and Engines of War, by his <i>Accidental
Invention</i> of that Fatal Instrument
<span class = "pagenum">125</span>
<span class = "folionum">G3</span>
the <i>Gun</i>, which he first communicated to the <i>Venetians</i>,
<i>Anno 1330</i>. Who gave by these (then so called) <i>Bombards</i>,
a&nbsp;notable discomfiture to the <i>Genoys</i>; and was next made use
of by the Inhabitants of the <i>Baltick Sea</i>; And at the Siege of
<i>Callice</i> <i>Anno 1347.</i> used by the <i>English</i>; who taught
it the <i>Mounsieur Frenchman</i>, and he gratified him with the death
of the Famous Leader, <i>Thomas Mountacute</i> Earl of <i>Salisbury</i>,
shot at the Siege of <i>Orleance</i>, <i>Anno. 1425</i>. After which
<i>Spain</i> learnt it, and the <i>Jews</i> and <i>Moors</i> from thence
taught the <i>Turk</i>; and from the first Invention of <i>large</i> and
<i>unweildy</i>, they were made fit for <i>Walls</i> and <i>Hands</i>;
and in fine <i>is a less expensive way of shedding blood than that of
Archery is</i>.</p>

<p>Thus you see how Ancient the Use of the <i>Bow</i> is, and how lately
its Disuse began (I&nbsp;mean in relation to the Common-Wealth, as a
defensive, or offensive Weapon) and how great the Ancient Fame of our
<i>English</i> was in the knowledge of it: However the Glory of it is
somewhat still preserved (though in a Pastime) by the Honourable City of
<i>London</i>, whose <i>Lord Mayor</i> <ins class = "correction" title =
"text reads ‘annnally’">annually</ins> appears to see a <i>Prize</i>
performed by
<span class = "pagenum">126</span>
<i>Shooting</i> with a Pound <i>Arrow</i>: And therefore all I have to
say more, is, That it is deservedly placed amongst my Recreations,
having <i>Metamorphosed</i> its Use, and become a Healthful Conserver,
instead of Destroyer of mens Bodies. And is vulgarly distinguished into
two sorts, the <i>Long-bow</i>, and the <i>Cross</i> or
<i>Crow-Bow</i>.</p>

<p>I shall begin first with the <i>Long-bow</i>, whose Use is (now) thus
to be understood. That it conduces much to the Health of our Body,
disperses our stagnated Blood, extends our contracted Limbs, and renders
the Members of our Bodies plyant, and flexible; and for the better
obtaining these Effects, the following Rules are to be Observed.</p>

<p>Before the <i>Archer</i> goes to his Sport (to follow the Method of
this Treatise) he must first provide himself with necessary
<i>Accoutrements</i>, <i>viz</i>, The <i>Bow</i> which claimes his first
Care, must be the best (<i>as best is best Cheap</i>) of <i>Spanish</i>
or <i>English Yew</i>, (the <i>VVithen</i>, or <i>Elme</i> being the
worst:) Next his <i>Shaft</i>, which must be of <i>Birch</i>,
<i>Sugar-Chest</i>, or <i>Brazeel</i>, with <i>Gray</i>, or <i>White
Feathers</i><ins class = "correction" title = ". invisible">. </ins></p>

<span class = "pagenum">127</span>
<span class = "folionum">G4</span>
<p>Thus equipt, to the Field, and here we are to understand three sorts
of <i>Marks</i>, <i>viz</i>, The <i>But</i>, which is a <i>Mark</i> that
is level, and requires a strong <i>Arrow</i> with a broad Feather: The
<i>Prick</i>, a&nbsp;<i>Mark</i> of some compass, of a certain distance,
requires an <i>Arrow</i> that is strong, and nimble, with a middle
Feather: The <i>Rover</i>, is an uncertain <i>Mark</i>, and
Proportionable to the distance, suit your <i>Arrows</i>. But before you
Shoot, hold a little, and hearken to your Charge.</p>

<p><i>First</i>, The <i>Archer</i> must have a good <i>Eye</i>, to see
and discern his <i>Mark</i>; attended with a <i>Knowing Judgment</i>, to
Understand the distance of Ground, and in what compass his <i>Arrow</i>
must Fly, and to take the true Advantage of a Side-Wind; and a Dexterity
to give his <i>Shaft</i> a sharp strong and sudden Loose, and without
hanging on the string, to draw his <i>Arrow</i> close to the Head, and
in an instant deliver&nbsp;it.</p>

<p><i>Secondly</i>, He must observe a <i>Decorum</i> in his standing
Posture, that his Body be fair, comely, and upright; his left Foot a
convenient stride before his right, with both his Hams stiff, his left
Arm holding his <i>Bow</i> in the midst,
<span class = "pagenum">128</span>
stretch’d out streight; and with his three Fore-Fingers and Thumb of his
right-hand, draw the string to his right Ear, the Notch of his
<i>Arrow</i> resting between his fore and long Fingers of his
Right-Hand, and the <i>Steel</i> of his <i>Arrow</i> below the
<i>Feathers</i> upon the middle <i>Knuckle</i> of his fore-finger, on
his Left-Hand, drawing it up close, as abovesaid.</p>

<p>The <i>Cross-Bow</i> (as I said in the Introduction to this
<i>Treatise</i>) is of equal Benefit and Pleasure with the
<i>Long-Bow</i>, when through an imbecillity in the <i>Arm</i> or
<i>Back</i>, that will not be a suitable Recreation: This <i>Bow</i>
must be made of the same Wood with the other, for <i>Gafel</i> carried
upon a string, and the other end being placed in a Rest, furnish your
self with strong and heavy <i>Arrows</i>, suitable to your <i>Bows</i>
strength, and all the foregoing <i>Marks</i>, may afford you an equal
Delight with the Former; but especially for Persons that have the
unhappiness of looking asquint, it is an excellent Disposer of the
sight, to a direct Line, and helps that <i>Watermans</i> quality of
<i>Looking one way, and Rowing another</i>. Thus much shall suffice for
<i>Shooting</i>.</p>

Institution, the <i>Lydians</i> being thought to have been the first
Inventors of <i>Sphæromachia</i>, which signifies <i>Bowling</i>, as
well as <i>Tennis-Playing</i>; besides these they instituted several
other Games, as the <i>Dice</i>, <i>Tables</i>, <i>Cards</i>, &amp;c.
Necessity, and Hunger enforcing them to that Ingenuity, as
<i>Persius</i> well observes, <i>Artis Magister, Ingenijque largitor

Famine, in the time of <i>Atis</i>, one of the Progenitors of
<i>Omphale</i>, they Devised these Games, that every second day playing
at them, they might beguile their Hungry Bellies, and drive away the
Tediousness of the Famine. And indeed, according to its Original
institution, of infinite use for the diverting Melancholly, for Exercise
of the Body, by runing and stirring in this Game, for helping likewise
sundry Bodily Infirmities, as the <i>Stone</i>, <i>Gravel</i>,

Pious, Learned and Sober Persons have sometimes made up the Company of a
<i>Bowling-Green</i> (tho I must confess rarely to be seen in those
common <i>Bowling-Allies</i> and <i>Bares</i>, which too usually are
pestered with <i>Damming-Rooks</i>, <i>Cunning Betters</i>, <i>Crafty
Matchers</i>, and base <i>Booty-Players</i>:) Herein we may see the
World moralized, or emblematically described, where most are short,
over, wide or wrong-Byassed, and few justle in to the Mistress
<i>Fortune</i>: On one side we find <i>Heraclitus</i> and his Followers
fret, vex, rail, swear and cavil at every thing; on the other side
<i>Democritus</i>, and his Company rejoice and laugh, as if they were
created for that purpose. On one side you may see the <i>Mimick</i>
screwing and twisting his Body into several Postures, which he perswades
himself adds either to the Swiftness or Slowness of his Bowl; On the
other side the senseless <i>Orator</i>, with his perswasive Intreaties
of <i>Rub, O&nbsp;Rub a little</i>; Or, <i>Flee, Flee</i>, and the like,
to hasten or retard the Speed of his Bowl; when if the stupid Bowl lend
a deaf Ear to his Perswasions, then he <i>belyes</i> his Disobedience,
by crying <i>Short, Short, O&nbsp;Short</i>, when tis gone ten yards
over; and when tis bowled short of the
<span class = "pagenum">131</span>
<i>Jack</i> six yards, he cryes, <i>Gone a Mile, a&nbsp;Mile,
a&nbsp;Mile</i>, &amp;c. But not to detain you any longer in
characterizing this excellent sport: (<i>Excellent</i> I mean if rightly
used) I&nbsp;shall before I lead you into the <i>Green</i> or
<i>Bare</i>, instruct you in some Rules, how to choose your
<i>Bowls</i>.</p>

<p>The first and greatest Cunning to be observed in <i>Bowling</i>, is
the right <i>chusing your Bowl</i>, which must be suitable to the
Grounds you design to run on, thus: For <i>close Alleys</i>, your best
Choice is the <i>Flat Bowl</i>: 2.&nbsp;For <i>open Grounds</i> of
Advantage, the <i>Round-Byassed-Bowl</i>; 3.&nbsp;For <i>Green
Swarths</i>, that are plain and level, the Bowl that is <i>Round as a
Ball</i>.</p>

<p>The next thing requires your Care is, <i>The chusing out your
Ground</i>, and preventing the Windings, Hangings, and many turning
<i>Advantages</i> of the same, whether it be in open wide places, as
<i>Bares</i> and <i>Bowling-Greens</i>, or in close
<i>Bowling-Alleys</i>.</p>

<p>Lastly, Have your <i>Judgment</i> about you to observe and
distinguish the <i>Risings</i>, <i>Fallings</i> and <i>Advantages</i> of
the Places where you Bowl: Have your <i>Wits</i> about you to avoid
being rookt of your Money: And have your Understanding
<span class = "pagenum">132</span>
about you, to know your best Time and Opportunity for this Recreation;
and finally a studious Care of your Words and Passions, and then
<i>Bowl</i> away, and you may deserve, <i>Well have you Bowled
indeed</i>.</p>

<p>But methinks I cannot conclude here, without admiring how aptly a
Bowling-Green is by the Divine <i>Quarles</i> characterized, in the
following Verses, thus.</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p>Brave pastime, <em>Readers</em>, to consume that Day,</p>
<p>Which without Pastime flies too swift away!</p>
<p>See how they Labour, as if Day and Night</p>
<p>Were both too short to serve their loose Delight?</p>
<p>See how their curved <em>Bodies</em> wreath, and skrue</p>
<p>Such Antick shapes as <em>Proteus</em> never knew:</p>
<p>One rapps an Oath, another deals a Curse,</p>
<p>He never better bowl’d, this never worse;</p>
<p>One rubs his itchless Elbow, shruggs and laughs,</p>
<p>The t’other bends his beetle-brows, and chafes;</p>
<p>Sometimes they whoop, sometimes the <em>Stygian</em> Cryes,</p>
<p>Send their black <em>Santo’s</em> to the blushing Skies:</p>
<p>Thus mingling Humours in a mad Confusion</p>
<p>They make bad Premisses and worse Conclusion.</p>
</div>

<p>Thus much for <i>Bowling</i>.</p>

<p><span class = "firstletter">T</span>his Recreation is of the same
Date for its <i>Antiquity</i> of Invention with <i>Bowling</i>, and for
the <i>Violence</i> of its Exercise to be preferred before it. This
sport indeed is of so universal an Acceptance, that Majesty it self is
pleased to design it its Recommendation, by tracking its laborious
steps; and <i>Princes</i> and <i>Lords</i> admire it too for the most
proper Recreation, to suit with <i>Innocence</i>, and <i>true
Nobility</i>. Here the body is briskly exercised more than ordinary, and
inured in <i>Agility</i> and <i>Nimbleness</i>; this renders the Limbs
flexible and mettlesom, and adapts them for the most Vigorous
Enterprize: It makes the languid and slothful, <i>brisk</i> and
<i>sprightful</i>; and rejects <i>Effeminacy</i> and <i>Delicacy</i>, as
contemptible and unworthy so Royal and Noble a Recreation: And so
General indeed is the Estimation this Exercise of <i>Tennis</i> amongst
most meets with, that it is reckoned one of the most absolute
Qualifications of a
<span class = "pagenum">134</span>
well-bred Gentleman, throughly to understand this famous Game.</p>

<p>But why should we wonder at the general Love Gentlemen have for this
Recreation, since it must be acknowledged, it challengeth as deserving a
place in the Catalogue of violent Exercises, as any that goes before it
in this Treatise; indeed it may be well rankt among those great
Excellencies of Exercise which rendered the <i>Lacedemonians</i>, Famous
to all Posterity for instructing their young Gentlemen and Noblemen in:
Nay for ought I know it is a <i>derivative Vertue</i> which descended to
the true <i>English</i> Gentleman, from that so excellent Method of
Education used amongst the Warlike Nation the <i>Gothes</i>: Who (as
<i>Olaus Magnus</i> informes us) amongst the greatest Severities, as
<i>Beatings</i> and <i>Wounds</i>, <i>Change of Heat into sudden
Cold</i>, <i>lying</i> (not on <i>Downe</i> but) upon <i>Boards</i>,
<i>coursely clad</i>, and <i>Feeding</i> on <i>Ordinary</i>, but strong
<i>Food</i>, used themselves to the most tedious, wearisome and Violent
Exercises, as <i>Riding</i>, <i>Darting</i>, <i>Shooting</i>, &amp;c.
<i>Wearing heavy Armes</i>, <i>Swimming on Horse-Back and in Armour</i>;
And had they been acquainted with this Exercise of <i>Tennis</i>,
<span class = "pagenum">135</span>
would not have omitted that neither: But I shall not enlarge any further
on its <i>Encomium</i>, its being the Pastime of the most knowing and
greatest men, shall stop any longer <i>Eulogies</i> my Pen can make on
its Worth and Excellence. All I have to say is, I&nbsp;am heartily
sorry, there are no <i>Rules</i> which fall within the Sphere of
<i>Demonstration</i>, to be laid down for my Readers use, for the right
prosecuting this Noble Game: Practice and Experience alone must be his
Information and Direction, and not any Writing may be communicated to
him: Only let me say this.</p>

<p><i>Tennis</i> and <i>Baloon</i> are Sports which are play’d almost
with the same Instruments; and therefore may be under one and the same
Head: The first is a pastime, used in close or open Courts, by striking
a little <i>Round Ball</i> to and fro, either with the <i>Palmes</i> of
the hands (and then is called <i>Pila palmaria</i> in Latin) or else a
<i>Racket</i>, made for the purpose, round with Net or Cat-gut, with a
Handle: The other a strong and moving Sport in the Open Fields with a
great Ball of a double Leather filled with Wind, and so driven to and
fro with the strength of a Mans Arm,
<span class = "pagenum">136</span>
armed in a Brace of Wood: And thus much shall suffice to speak of the
<i>Baloon</i> and <i>Tennis</i>; only let me desire you, let not this or
any other Pastime disturb your Minds; divert you from the diligent and
careful Prosecution of your own lawful Business; or invite you to throw
away your Time and Money too lavishly and idley; nor engage you in any
Passion; that so you may not offend God, dislike your <i>Neighbour</i>,

<p><span class = "firstletter">S</span>ince this Recreation of
<i>Ringing</i> is become so highly esteemed, for its excellent
<i>Harmony of Musick</i> it affords the <i>Ear</i>, for its
<i>Mathematical Invention</i> delighting the <i>Mind</i>, and for the
<i>Violence of its Exercise</i> bringing Health to the <i>Body</i>,
causing it to transpire plentifully, and by Sweats dissipate and expel
those Fuliginous thick <i>Vapours</i>, which <i>Idleness</i>,
<i>Effeminacy</i> and <i>Delicacy</i> subject men to; I&nbsp;say for
these and sundry other Reasons, I&nbsp;was induced to bring this of
<i>Ringing</i> into the Company of <i>Exercises</i> in this Treatise,
that I might as well recreate you with some health-conducing Pleasure at
<i>home</i>, as I have carryed you <i>abroad</i>, and there endeavoured
to please you in what Pastime your Inclinations may most peculiarly
select.</p>

<p>Whosoever would then become an accurate Master of this excellent Art
and Pleasure, and is very desirous to be esteemed an Elaborate and
Ingenious <i>Ringer</i>, and be enrolled amongst
<span class = "pagenum">139</span>
that Honoured <i>Society</i> of <b>Colledge Youths</b>; I&nbsp;must beg
Leave to instruct him before he enters the <i>Bell-free</i>, in these
ensuing short Rules, which he must strictly observe. <i>viz.</i></p>

<p>1. That as all <i>Musick</i> consists in these six plain
<i>Notes</i>, <i>La Sol Fa Mi Re Ut</i>; so in <i>Ringing</i>,
a&nbsp;Peal of Bells is Tuned according to these Principles of Musick:
For as each <i>Bell takes its Denomination from the Note it Sounds</i>,
by its being flatter or deeper, as, <i>First</i>, or Treble,
<i>Second</i>, <i>Third</i>, <i>Fourth</i>, &amp;c. as they are in
number to <i>Ten</i> or <i>Twelve</i> Bells, the Last being called the
<i>Tennor</i>; So must they successively strike one after another both
<i>Fore-stroke</i> and <i>Back-stroke</i>, in a due Musical Time or
Equidistance, to render their Harmony the more pleasant, and to make the
Young Practitioner the better informed to observe the <i>Life of
Musick</i>, and indeed of true Ringing, <i>Time</i>; and therefore is
called, <i>Round-Ringing</i>.</p>

<p>2. As in Musick, so in Ringing there are <i>three Concords</i>, so
called from their Melodious Harmony and Agreement, which Principally are
these; <i>Thirds</i>, <i>viz.</i> 1&nbsp;3, 2&nbsp;4. <i>&amp;c.</i>
<i>Fifths</i> 1&nbsp;5, 2&nbsp;6 <i>&amp;c.</i> <i>Eights</i> 1&nbsp;8,
2&nbsp;9, 3&nbsp;10 &amp;c. and these are the more
<span class = "pagenum">140</span>
pleasant according to the Number of Bells they are struck on, and as
they are struck, whether seperately or mutually. From hence
<i>Changes</i> are made, which is only a Changing place of one
<i>Note</i> with another, so variously, as Musick may be heard a
thousand wayes of Harmony; which being so obvious to common Observation,
I&nbsp;shall not go about to demonstrate; for that if two may be varied
two wayes, surely by the <i>Rule of Multiplication</i>, a&nbsp;Man may
easily learn how many times 6,&nbsp;7, 8, 9, 10, or 12 Bells Notes may
be varied, which will run almost <i>ad infinitum</i>.</p>

<p>3. For the better observing the Ringing of <i>Changes</i> or
<i>Rounds</i>, these three things are to be noted.</p>

<p>1. <i>The Raising true in Peal.</i></p>

<p>2. <i>Ringing at a low Compass</i>; And</p>

<p>3. <i>Ceasing in true Peal</i>; All which three are the most
essential Parts to render a Practitioner <i>Excellent</i><ins class =
"correction" title = ". invisible">. </ins></p>

<p>1. For <i>Raising a Peal of Bells true</i>, the modern &amp; best
Practice recommends the <i>swiftest and quickest possible</i>, every one
taking Assistance to raise his Bell, as its going requires: The
<i>lesser</i> Bells as <i>Treble</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i> being by main
strength <i>held down</i> in their first Sway (or pull)
<span class = "pagenum">141</span>
to get time for the striking of the rest of Larger Compass; and so
continued to be strong pulled till Frame-high, and then may be slackned:
The <i>Bigger</i>, as <i>Tenor</i>, &amp;c. must be <i>pincht</i> or
checkt over head, that the Notes may be heard to strike roundly and
hansomely. Observe that all the Notes strike round at one Pull:
I&nbsp;do not mean the First; but ’tis according to the Bigness and
Weightiness of your Bells: However in raising a Peal, do not let one
<i>Bell</i> strike before the rest, or miss when the rest do; this is
contrary to the Strict Rules of <i>true Ringing</i>: And this is called
<i>Round-Ringing</i>. Now if you design to raise a Peal of Bells for
<i>Changes</i>, you ought to raise them to a Set-Pull, as the most
proper for commanding the Notes, and he who is not well skilled to
manage his Bell at a <i>Set-Pull</i>, will be apt to drop or overturn
it, be in a Wood, and fruitlessly toil and moil himself. Therefore in
practising the Setting of a Bell, cast your Eye about the other
Bell-Ropes, during your managing your own, that you may accustome your
selfe to manage it according to the <i>Change</i>.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">142</span>
<p>2. For <i>Ringing at a Low Compass</i>, is thus observed: By keeping
a due <i>punctum</i> or beat of Time, in the successive striking one
after another of every Bell; the <i>best Ringer</i> being set to the
<i>Treble</i>, that may guide and direct the rest of the Notes in their
due <i>Measure</i>.</p>

<p>3. For <i>Ceasing a Peal of Bells</i>; Let them fall gradually from a
set <i>Peal</i>, checking them only at Sally, till the low Compass
renders it useless; and when so low, that for want of Compass, they can
scarce strike at Back-stroak; then let the <i>Treble</i>-Ringer stamp,
as a Signal, to notify, that the next time they come to strike at the
Fore-stroke, to check them down, to hinder their striking the
Back-stroke; yet Fore-stroke continued, till brought to a neat and
gracefull Chime, which may be the <i>Finis</i> to that <i>Peal</i>.</p>

<p>Thus much in short, for <i>Raising</i>, <i>Round-Ringing</i>, and
<i>Ceasing</i> a <i>Peal</i> of <i>Bells</i>; I&nbsp;come next to lead
you forth into that spacious <i>Field</i> of Variety of <i>Changes</i>,
and present you with Instructions that may be meerly necessary, for the
right Understanding the several kinds of them.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">143</span>
<p>Now in <i>Ringing Changes</i>, two of our best Senses, are to be
employed, <i>viz.</i> The <i>Ear</i>, and the <i>Eye</i>: The
<i>Ear</i>, Hearing when to make a <i>Change</i>; and the <i>Eye</i>
directing the <i>Bell</i> in making it: The <i>Bells</i> being the
Object of the Former, and the <i>Bell-Ropes</i> the Object of the
Latter. And to render both the Eye and Ear Usefull in Ringing
<i>Changes</i>, these <i>Five</i> things are throughly to be
Understood</p>

<p><i>First.</i> Endeavour to distinguish the <i>Notes</i> of a
<i>Peal</i> of <i>Bells</i>, one from another while Ringing.</p>

<p><i>Secondly</i>, Learn to apprehend the Places of the
<i>Notes</i><ins class = "correction" title = ". invisible">. </ins></p>

<p><i>Thirdly</i>, Understand the Precendency of <i>Notes</i>.</p>

<p><i>Fourthly</i>, How to make a <i>Change</i> in <i>Ringing</i>.</p>

<p><i>Fifthly</i>, and <i>Lastly</i>. How to Practise the four
fore-going Notions in General.</p>

<p>1. <i>To know the Notes of a Peal of Bells asunder</i> (which is easy
in <i>Round-Ringing</i>) in <i>Changes</i> is thus: Get the skill of
Tuning them with your <i>Voice</i>, by imitating their Notes while
<i>Ringing</i>. Or if you are acquainted, either by your self or Friend,
with some <i>Singing-master</i>, or one who has skill in <i>Singing</i>,
<span class = "pagenum">144</span>
get him to instruct you in the true Pitch of any <i>Note</i>, and aid
your distinguishing them; otherwise you may be puzzled in this, to know
which is <i>Treble</i>, which <i>Second</i>, &amp;c. as in 532641,
<i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<p>2. To know the Places of the <i>Notes</i>, is no way better to be
apprehended than thus: The Practitioner ought to form an <i>Idea</i> in
his Head of the Place of each <i>Note</i>, whether in a direct
<i>Line</i>, or <i>Obliquely</i>; and representing them by a
<i>Figure</i> in his mind, see (as it were) by the Eye of his
Understanding each stroke of the <i>Bell</i>, as the
<i>Treble</i>,&nbsp;1. <i>Second</i>&nbsp;2. <i>Third</i>&nbsp;3.
<i>&amp;c.</i> so that as the <i>Ear</i> is to direct him, when to make
the Change, so a right Apprehension of the <i>Motion</i> and
<i>Places</i> of the <i>Notes</i>, ought to be a means to guide his
Ear.</p>

<p>3. The Precedency of <i>Notes</i>, is of a very Obvious
Demonstration; thus: In Ringing <i>Changes</i>, the Fore and
Back-stroke, successively following one another, are properly said to
<i>Lye behind</i> one another, according to their places of striking. Or
in short, in 12345. the <i>Note</i> that leads either at Fore or
Back-stroak, is said to <i>Lye before</i> the rest, and the last to be
behind. As
<span class = "pagenum">145</span>
<span class = "folionum">H</span>
the 2 is said to lye behind the&nbsp;1, so it lyeth before the&nbsp;3,
as the 3 lyeth behind the&nbsp;2, so it lyeth before the&nbsp;4. And so
of as many as are <i>Rung</i>.</p>

<p>4. The manner of making a <i>Change</i>, is very common, and needs no
particular, but general Rule; That it is made by moving one <i>Note</i>
into anothers place, Up and Down, as Occasion requires; but all usually
made by two <i>Notes</i> standing one next the other, as hereafter may
be Observed.</p>

<p><i>Lastly</i>, In your Ringing <i>Changes</i>, these two things (in
which consists the practick part of this Art) are to be rightly
considered. <i>First</i>, Readily to know which two <i>Bells</i> are to
make the succeeding <i>Change</i>. And <i>Secondly</i>, to consider (if
you are concern’d in it) what <i>Bell</i> you are to follow in making
it. To understand which the more perfectly, you must imprint in your
memory, the Method of the <i>Changes</i> prick’d in <i>Figures</i>, and
to be expert likewise in setting them down divers wayes, and making any
<i>Figure</i> a <i>Hunt</i> at Pleasure; and thus without pausing or
hesitating to consider the Course, you may throughly understand the
Methods; the Four preceding Observations being first perfectly
understood.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">146</span>
<p>There are two wayes of <i>Ringing Changes</i>, viz. By <i>Walking</i>
them, as the Artists stile it; or by <i>Whole-pulls</i>, or
<i>Half-pulls</i>: <i>Walking</i> is, when in one <i>Change</i> the
<i>Bells</i> go round, <i>Four</i>, <i>Six</i>, or <i>Eight</i> times;
which is a most incomparable way to improve a young Practitioner, by
giving him time to consider, which two <i>Bells</i> do make the next
succeeding <i>Change</i>, and in making it, what <i>Bell</i> each is to
follow; so that by this means (by his industry) he may be capable of
Ringing at <i>Whole-Pulls</i>; Which is, when the <i>Bells</i> go round
in a Change at fore and back-stroke; and a new Change is made every time
they are pulled down at Sally: This an Ancient Practice, but is now laid
aside, since we have learnt a more advantageous way of hanging our
<i>Bells</i>, that we can manage a <i>Bell</i> with more ease at a
Set-Pull than formerly: So that Ringing at <i>Half-Pulls</i> is now the
modern general Practice; that is, When one Change is made at
Fore-Stroke, another at Back-Stroke, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<p>I have one Thing more to add in these <i>introductory</i> Rules, and
that in short is this: He that Rings the slowest <i>Hunt</i>, ought to
notify the <i>extreme Changes</i>;
<span class = "pagenum">147</span>
<span class = "folionum">H2</span>
which is, when the Leading <i>Bell</i> is pulling down, that he might
make the Change next before the Extreme, he ought to say,
<i>Extreme</i>. By this means, betwixt the Warning and the Extreme there
will be one compleat Change.</p>


<h5><i>Of Changes</i>, &amp;c.</h5>

<p>There are <i>two kinds of Changes</i>, viz. <i>Plain Changes</i>, and
<i>Cross-Peals</i>; which Terms do denote the <i>Nature</i> of them; for
as the first is stiled <i>Plain</i>, so are its Methods easy; and as the
second is called <i>Cross</i>, so are its Methods cross and intricate:
The First have a general Method, in which all the Notes (except Three)
have a direct <i>Hunting-Course</i>, moving gradually under each other,
plainly and uniformly: <i>Plain</i> are likewise termed <i>single
Changes</i>, because there is but one single Change made in the striking
all the Notes round, either at fore or back-stroke. But the Second is
<i>various</i>, each Peal differing in its Course from all others; and
<i>in Cross-Peals as many Changes may be made as the Notes will
permit</i>. In short, as to <i>Plain-Changes</i>, I&nbsp;shall not
dilate on them here, it being so <i>plainly</i> understood by
<span class = "pagenum">148</span>
every one that lately have rung a <i>Bell</i> in peal; All therefore I
shall add is this, That any two Notes that strike next together may make
a Change, which may be done either <i>single</i> or <i>double</i>, as
you list. The <i>single</i>, by changing Two Notes; and the
<i>Double</i>, by changing Four, <i>i. e.</i> Two to make one Change,
and two another; which is however called <i>One double Change</i>, and
not two Changes; because tis made in striking the Notes of the
<i>Bells</i> once round. For the rest, common Observation and Practice
bids me stop here, and demands a Clearing those dark Intricacies which
attend <i>Cross-Peals</i>.</p>


<h5><i>Of Cross-Peals.</i></h5>

<p><i>Art</i>, being a curious Searcher and Enquirer into the hidden and
abstruse <i>Arcana</i>’s of Difficulties, having found out that dark and
remote Corner of Obscurity, wherein the nature of these
<i>Cross-Peals</i> lay at first invelopped, has exhibited by its
<i>Proselytes</i> the ensuing Demonstrations of that which before lay
mantled up in Doubt: And to effect this, these <i>Favourites of Art</i>
have, like ingenious Architects, made Order
<span class = "pagenum">149</span>
<span class = "folionum">H3</span>
and Method the <i>Basis</i>, on which the whole Structure depends: For
in these <i>Cross-Peals</i> we must observe the <i>prime Movement</i>,
which sets the whole Frame a going, and that is called the <i>Hunt</i>,
which hath <i>One constant Uniform Motion throughout the Peal</i>, and
different from that of the other Notes; and indeed by this the whole
Course of the Peal is Steered. This keeps a continual motion through the
other Notes, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> From Leading, to strike behind, and from
thence again to Lead; which is called one <i>compleat Course</i>.</p>

<p>Some Peals upon <i>five Bells</i> consist of <i>single</i> Courses,
wherein are ten Changes, and twelve Courses make the Peal. Others upon
Five, consist of Double Courses, wherein are twenty Changes to every
Course, and six Courses in the Peal.</p>

<p>Upon <i>six Bells</i> there are likewise <i>single</i> and
<i>double</i> Courses, <i>viz.</i> Twelve Changes in every single
Course, as in <i>Grandsire Bob</i>, &amp;c. and Twenty-four Changes in
every Double Course, as in <i>Colledge Bobs</i>, that being the first
Change of every Course, wherein the <i>Hunt</i> leaves Leading: In
short, judiciously observe the first Course of any <i>Cross-Peal</i>,
<span class = "pagenum">150</span>
and you will soon see the <ins class = "correction" title = "second ‘e’ invisible">general</ins> Method of the whole Peal: All Courses in
Cross-Peals agreeing in these following three Respects. First, <i>In the
motion of the Hunt</i>. Secondly, <i>In the motion of the rest of the
Notes</i>: And Thirdly, <i>In making the Changes</i>. Which three things
being well (to omit Instances of Demonstration) and narrowly observed,
will be very helpful both in pricking and ringing Courses; the first and
third for directing you in Pricking them, and the first and second in
Ringing them.</p>

<p>There is one <i>Difficulty</i> to be removed e’re I can come to prick
down those <i>Peals</i> I design to be the Subject of the Discourse of
this <i>Epitome</i>, and that is, <i>How to make the first Changes at
the beginning of each Peal</i>; I&nbsp;mean to make the <i>Second</i>,
<i>Third</i>, <i>Fourth</i>, &amp;c. <i>whole Hunts</i>; and this in
short is thus directed: In any <i>Cross-Peal</i> the <span class =
"missing"><i>Whole Hunt</i></span> may move either up or down at the
beginning; and the Motion of the <i>Whole Hunt</i>, in the first Course
of each of the following Peals, will direct the first Motion of any
<i>Cross-hunt</i>, and by Consequence of making the first Changes in
that Peal. Taking along with you this Observation.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">151</span>
<span class = "folionum">H4</span>
<p>That whensoever the first Change of any Peal happens to be
<i>single</i>, it must be made at the back-stroke, to prevent <i>cutting
Compass</i>; and the like when a double Change happens first in a Peal
of <i>Triples and doubles</i>: But when it happens, that the first
Change is made at the Back-stroke, then Consequently the Bells at the
end of the Peal will come round at a Fore-stroke Change.</p>

<p>I shall omit speaking to any of the several <i>Peals</i> on <i>four
or five Bells</i>; for that in my Opinion little <i>Musick</i> is heard,
though much <i>practical Observation</i> is made, from them; and
therefore shall begin with <i>Grandsire-Bob</i>, as having mentioned it
but just before in my general View I made of <i>Cross-Peals</i>.</p>


<h5><i>Grandsire Bob.</i></h5>

<p><i>Bob</i> Changes take their Name from this, <i>viz.</i> When the
<i>Treble</i> leads in the <i>Second</i> and <i>Third</i>, and the
<i>Fifth</i> and <i>Sixth</i>’s places, then they are called
<i>Bob-Changes</i>. In Ringing which you are to observe these Rules,
<i>viz.</i></p>

<p>Whatsoever Bells you follow when you <i>Hunt up</i>, the same Bells
in the same order you must follow in <i>Hunting
<span class = "pagenum">152</span>
down</i>; as in the Changes here prickt, where the <i>Treble</i> hunting
up <i>First</i> follow <i>Second</i>, then <i>Fourth</i>, and then
<i>Sixth</i>; when it comes behind, <i>First</i> follows <i>Second</i>,
in hunting down <i>Fourth</i>; and when hunted up follows <i>Sixth</i>
in the same Order: The like may be observed in Ringing any other Bell,
with this Difference betwixt the Whole-hunt and the rest, <i>viz.</i>
Every time the Whole-hunt leaves the <i>Treble</i>’s place, and hunts
up, it followeth different Bells from what it did at its first
hunting&nbsp;up.</p>

<p>In the ensuing Peal here prickt are <i>Eighteen-score</i> Changes,
wanting one. It may be Rung with any <i>Hunts</i>, and begin the Changes
<i>Triple</i> and <i>Double</i>: You may make your Extreme at the first,
second, or third <i>single Bob</i>; or the first, second, or third time,
that the half and <i>quarter-hunts</i> dodg behind; the <i>single</i>
must be made behind in either of these.</p>

<p>Thus much for the <i>Grandsire-Bob</i>; I shall next collect what
<i>London Peals</i> I think most Harmonious, and agreeable, without
troubling my self to go to <i>Oxford</i>, or <i>Nottingham</i>, or
<i>Redding</i>, to enquire after their different Methods of <i>Peal<ins
class = "correction" title = "invisible">e</ins>s</i>, as indeed
needless; <ins class = "correction" title = "words supplied from 1696">and my</ins> reason is this: Because I think the same Rules for
<i>Peales</i> that are suitable to our <i>London Genius</i>, may
challenge likewise an Acceptance amongst other <i>Cities</i>; provided
their <i>Steeples</i> are furnished with as many, and as good
<i>Bells</i>, and their <i>Belfree’s</i> with as ingenious
<span class = "pagenum">155</span>
and elaborate <i>Ringers</i> as here in <i>London</i>.</p>

<p>I shall begin then with <i>Peales upon Six Bells</i>, and herein in
order, measure out the Delights on <i>Peals</i> from <i>Six</i> to
<i>Eight</i> Bells, and setting out early, present you with</p>


<h5><i>The Morning Exercise.</i></h5>

<p><i>Doubles</i> and <i>Singles</i>. The whole <i>Hunt</i> is the
<i>Treble</i>, which <i>Hunteth</i> up into the <i>Second</i>,
<i>Third</i>, and <i>Fourth</i> places, lying twice in each; and then
lyeth still in the <i>Sixth</i> place, having dodged behind, and makes
another, and then <i>Hunts</i> down as it <i>Hunted</i> up, and then
leads four times. Observing the manner of its Pricking, and its
Practice, may excuse any further defining&nbsp;it.</p>

<h4><i>A Cure for <em>Melancholy</em>.</i><br>
<span class = "subhead"><i>Doubles</i> and <i>Singles</i>.</span></h4>

<p>I should think it needless to explain the method of prick’d Peales,
and give a large Definition of them, when their plain Demonstration
might be sufficient; However, as the Old <i>Phrase</i> is, <i>Because
’tis usual</i>, something shall be said of this too.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">157</span>
<p>The <i>Treble</i> is the whole <i>Hunt</i>, as in the former, and
leads four times, and lyeth behind as many, and twice in every other
place; the two <i>Bells</i> in the 3d. add 4th. places continue dodging,
when the <i>Treble</i> moves out of the 4th. place; untill it comes down
there again, and then the two hindmost dodge, till the <i>Treble</i>
displaceth them; who maketh every double <i>Change</i>, except when it
lieth behind, and then the double is on the four first, and on the four
last when it leads. Every Single (except when the <i>Treble</i> lies
there) is in the 5th. and 6th. places; or if possessed by the
<i>Treble</i>, then in the 3d. and 4th. places: Every <i>Bell</i>
(except the <i>Treble</i>) lies four times in the Second place: But
enough; a&nbsp;word is enough to the Wise. See it here Deciphered.</p>

promised to say somewhat of them, I&nbsp;shall be as good as my Word,
(the Character of an Honest man) and present you with a couple of
Examples, and then proceed to <i>Peales</i> upon <i>Eight</i>: But this
I must crave leave to premise, That Variety of <i>Changes</i> may be
prick’d upon Seven <i>bells</i>, as <i>Triples</i>, and <i>Doubles</i>,
<i>Triples Doubles</i>, and <i>Single Doubles</i>, &amp;c.
<span class = "pagenum">166</span>
and the same Methods may be prick’d upon <i>Seven</i>, as may be upon
<i>Five</i>, the true difference of Proportion being observed; but to
proceed.</p>


<h5><i>Dodging Triples.</i></h5>

<p><i>Triples</i> and <i>Doubles</i>, and indeed all <i>Peals</i> upon
Six, may likewise go upon Seven <i>Bells</i>, thus,</p>

<h5><i>Peals of Eight Bells.</i></h5>

<p>Without amusing our selves with what Notes are most <i>Musical</i>,
to <i>lye behind</i>, we will come to the matter of Fact; for those
Methods of <i>Peals</i> that are prick’t on <i>Six</i>, may be the same
upon <i>Eight</i>, Observing only, that <i>Triples</i> and
<i>Doubles</i> upon <i>Six</i>, must be <i>Quadruples</i>, and
<i>Triples</i> upon <i>Eight</i>. <i>Doubles</i> upon <i>Six</i>, must
be <i>Triples</i> upon <i>Eight</i>, &amp;c. Now then to our purpose of
Demonstration; We generally give preference to things, as they are
dignified with some eminent Title, and are ready to suppose they may
have something more than ordinary, that merits such Esteem, whereof the
Title is but a Sign, or Token; which Custome induced me to head my
Discourse upon <i>Changes</i> on <i>Eight Bells</i>, with that which
carries the most <i>Swelling</i> Title.</p>


<h4>The Imperial Bob:<br>
<span class = "subhead"><i>Quadruples</i> and
<i>Triples</i>.</span></h4>

<p>The <i>Treble</i> hath a dodging <i>Course</i>, the two first, and
two last <i>Bells</i> always dodge, till hindred by the <i>Treble</i>,
the
<span class = "pagenum">169</span>
<span class = "folionum">I</span>
two next to these, lying still one <i>Change</i>, dodge the next, till
the <i>Treble</i> hinders them too. Those in the 5th. and 6th. places
dodge (the Treble being behind) and those in the 3d. and 4th. places
likewise dodge (the Treble being before) and so till hindered by the
Treble.</p>

<p>These may be prick’t several other wayes, but that I Omit here for
Brevities sake; The <i>Dodging</i> is without Intermission, except an
hinderance comes by the <i>Treble</i>; as likewise between two Bells,
until <i>Treble</i> parts the Fray. The <i>Bobs</i> are <i>Triple
Changes</i>, as the <i>Treble</i> leads; in the <i>1st.</i> <i>2d.</i>
and <i>6th.</i> the Bell in the <i>4th.</i> place lies still at the
<i>Bobs</i>, and in the <i>3d.</i> <i>4th.</i> and <i>5th.</i> that in
the <i>2d.</i> place lies still.</p>

<p>Each of these will go 112 Changes, and by making Bobs 224, 336, or
672.</p>

<p>In this Change the 4th. Bell must first hunt up into the Sevenths
place, and then the 4 and 8 alwayes dodge behind throughout the Peal,
unless when obstructed by the <i>Treble</i>. The Bell that moves up into
the 6th. place, when the <i>Treble</i> moves thence down, lies still
there, till displaced by the <i>Treble</i>; during
<span class = "pagenum">177</span>
<span class = "folionum">I5</span>
which time the two hind Bells dodge, and the <i>five first</i> go a
perfect <i>Hunting-Course</i>: And when likewise the <i>Treble</i>
moveth out the 5th. place the five first Bells go a
<i>Hunting-Course</i>, till it comes down there again: By this method it
will go 80 Changes, and by <i>Bobs</i> 160, 240, or 480. The <i>Bob</i>
is made as in the foregoing Changes.</p>

<p>And here I thought to make an end of the Art of Ringing, but
<i>Cynthius aurem vellit</i>, the young Practitioner, whose only
Information is hereby aimed at, plucks me by the Sleeve, and tells me in
the Ear, That tho Peals upon six, as <i>Triples</i> and <i>Doubles</i>,
&amp;c. make excellent Musick upon Eight <i>Bells</i>, 4&nbsp;8,
6&nbsp;8, 4&nbsp;1, or 1&nbsp;8 lying behind: Or, <i>Triples</i> and
<i>Doubles</i> upon the six middle <i>Bells</i>, the <i>Tennor</i> lying
behind; yet for him who is not arrived to such a perfection of Skill, at
to Ring these compleat Peals, the most proper and easy for him are
<i>Set-Changes</i>, which are founded on these <i>Grounds</i>.</p>

<p>First, <i>Placing the Bells Fifths</i>; thus: The 4 must hunt up
behind the&nbsp;7, the&nbsp;3, behind the&nbsp;6, and the 2 behind
the&nbsp;5; Or the one may hunt down under the other, as the 5 under
the&nbsp;2, the 6
<span class = "pagenum">178</span>
under&nbsp;3, and 7 under&nbsp;4: Or if you will, first let a
<i>Single</i>, next a <i>Double</i>, and then a <i>Triple</i> Change be
made on the Middle <i>Bells</i>, all coming to the same effect; for then
the Changes will lye <i>Fifths</i> thus, 1&nbsp;5, 2&nbsp;6, 3&nbsp;7,
4&nbsp;8. In the Peal four <i>Concords</i> are to be regarded, The first
1&nbsp;5; the second 2&nbsp;6. the third 3&nbsp;7. and the fourth
4&nbsp;8.</p>

<p>These four <i>Concords</i> may go the Methods of any Changes upon
four <i>Bells</i>; 1,&nbsp;5 being taken for the <i>Treble</i>;
2,&nbsp;6 for the <i>Second</i>; 3,&nbsp;7 for the <i>Third</i>; and
4,&nbsp;8 <ins class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘for / for’">for</ins> the <i>Fourth</i>; and the <i>Concords</i> may Change
places with one another, as you list. In which this Observation is
highly necessary, That the two Notes of every Concord must constantly
attend each other in their Motion; that is, whenever one of the two
Notes moves, the other must follow&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>Or Secondly, <i>Place the Bells</i> Thirds; thus: The 6 4 and 2 must
hunt up, or else the 3&nbsp;5&nbsp;7 down; or otherwise on the middle
most <i>Bells</i> let a <i>Triple</i>, <i>Double</i> or <i>Single</i>
Change be made, they are to one effect; and then the <i>Bells</i> will
lie <i>Thirds</i> thus, 1&nbsp;3. 5&nbsp;7. 2&nbsp;4. 6&nbsp;8. Herein
are four <i>Concords</i> observable;
<span class = "pagenum">179</span>
as in the former Peal, <i>viz</i>, 1&nbsp;3. 5&nbsp;7. 2&nbsp;4.
6&nbsp;8. These <i>Concords</i> may go the Methods of any Changes upon
Four <i>Bells</i>, 1,&nbsp;3 being taken for the Treble; 5,&nbsp;7 for
the Second; 2,&nbsp;4 for the third; and 6,&nbsp;8 for the fourth;
moving in the same manner as before shewed.</p>

<p>By these <i>Grounds</i> Variety of excellent &amp; Musical Changes
are to be Rung; <i>Any Concord may be made a Hunt</i>, and to move up
and down at the begining.</p>

<p>In Ringing these <i>Set-Changes</i>, the Note will lye sometimes
<i>Fifths</i>, sometimes <i>Thirds</i>, and sometimes <i>both</i>, and
then to <i>Clam</i> them, is admirable Musick: Clamming is, when each
<i>Concord</i> strike together; which being done true the 8 will strike
as but four <i>Bells</i>, &amp; make a Melodious Harmony. You may
<i>Clam</i> two or three bouts, and then strike as many times Open,
alternatively, one <i>Clam</i> one Pull, and Open the next,
<i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<p>Thus much shall suffice for my treating of <ins class = "correction"
title = "text reads ‘Riging’">Ringing</ins>, and had not the Variety of
its <i>Theme</i>, in which I was insensibly engaged, invited my Tast of
something of every thing: I&nbsp;had not enlarged so much as I have; but
I hope the pleasure
<span class = "pagenum">180</span>
it may produce, will attone for my dilating on so delightful a Subject;
All I have therefore to add is, some <i>Advice</i> to the <i>Ringer</i>,
in the Lawfull prosecuting this <i>Recreation</i>; and that is this.</p>

<p>When God in <i>Israels Exodus</i> out of <i>Egypt</i>, commanded
<i>Moses</i> to Consecrate <i>Aaron</i>, and his Sons, and invest them
with those <i>Pontificial</i> Vestments, according to the Pattern God
had cut out, it is observable, that the <i>Robe</i> of the <i>Ephod</i>,
was with a particular Circumstance of Beauty to be Adorned, by hanging
the <i>Hem</i> of it with <i>Golden Bells</i>, and <i>Pomegranates</i>,
each placed in an orderly Position, one by another round: This was the
first institution we can read of, for <ins class = "correction" title =
"text unchanged: missing ‘of’?">the Use <i>Bells</i></ins> in Sacred
Offices; but the reason was this: Because in <i>Aarons</i> Ministration
before God, when he entered into the Holy Place, and when he came out,
the Sound of the <i>Bells</i> might be heard in the <i>Temple</i>, for a
<i>Memorial</i> to the Children of his People. This Use of Bells
continue in the <i>Aaronical</i> Order, to this day. From hence the
<i>Christian Church</i> likewise (of which the Church under the
<i>Mosaic</i> Dispensation
<span class = "pagenum">181</span>
was but a <i>Type</i>) has made Use of <i>Bells</i>, for the notifying
the Time when the People are to Assemble, and made a Signal for
convocating them together to the <i>Temple</i>; and herein differing
from the <i>Mahometans</i>, in the <i>Steeples</i> of whose
<i>Temples</i>, are never found any <i>Bells</i>, but <i>Cryers</i>,
Persons who with a loud Voyce call them to Prayers.</p>

<p>Now then let us make this Use of the Institution of <i>Bells</i>.
<i>First</i>, Let not only the <i>Musick</i> and <i>Delight</i> the
<i>Bells</i> give thee, invite thee to come to the <i>Temple</i>, to be
partaker of that Pleasure they may afford thy Body, but let their
<i>Musick</i> invite thee to come thither when they call thee, to
exercise thy Soul in Devotion; to God. Do not let thy frequent coming
thither on <i>Week-days</i> for thy Diversion, make thee absent thy self
on <i>Sundays</i> from thy Devotion; but let their Original Use make
thee mindful of the <i>Sanctum Sanctorum</i>, the most Holy Place. Do
not let the <i>Sunday</i> Mornings Peal engage thy presence then, and
the <i>Ale-House</i> have thy company afterwards. Be as quick in hearing
the <i>Chyming</i> for <i>Prayers</i>, as thou art in the <i>Notes</i>
for <i>Pleasure</i>.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">182</span>
<div class = "verse">
<p>When ere the <em>Old-Exchange</em> of Profit Rings,</p>
<p>Her Silver <em>Saints-Bell</em>, of uncertain Gains,</p>
<p>Thy Merchant-soul can stretch both <em>Legs &amp; Wings</em>,</p>
<p>How canst thou run, and take unwearied Pains?</p>
</div>

<p>And shouldst thou not be as nimble, when the <i>Saints-bell</i> of
the Church sounds in thy Ears, and calls thee to attend the
<i>Priest</i>, who now signifyes his entrance into the
<i>Holy-place</i>, and invites thee to joyn with him in the Sacrifice of
Prayers and Praises.</p>

<p><i>Secondly</i>, Nor let the Bells be made thy Lullaby, to drown some
Dissatisfaction, and so makes thee repair to the <i>Belfree</i>, (like
the <i>Nurse</i> to her <i>Whistle-Bells</i>) to quiet thy disturbed
mind, and thus (as the Divine Poet excellently expresses it) to silence
it with</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p>Look, Look, What’s here! A dainty Golden thing?</p>
<p>See how the dancing <em>Bells</em> turn round, and Ring</p>

breed,</p>
<p>An hundred Kisses; here’s a <em>Knack</em> indeed,
<em>&amp;c.</em></p>
</div>

<p>But let the <i>Altar</i> have thy presence in Communion with God, in
Prayers for his Grace, and Patience, to support any Calamity that may
fall upon thee.</p>

<p><i>Lastly</i>, Let the Bells put you in mind
<span class = "pagenum">183</span>
to contemplate on <i>Death</i>, and every time you Ring, think how long
it may be ere one of these may be your turn to have to sound</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p>The Nine sad Knolls of a Dull <em>Passing-Bell</em>,</p>
<p>With the loud Language of a Nightly Knell.</p>
</div>

<p>This in short, is the use the <i>Ringer</i> ought to make of this his
Recreation, which if he makes duly and rightly, he may then Lawfully
enjoy all the Benefit he can desire from it. And here I shall make an
end of this Observation by way of Advice to the <i>Ringer</i>, which
perhaps coming amongst Recreations may look unseasonable; But I know (at
least presume) if I meet with an ingenious Reader, I&nbsp;shall need no
Apology, for playing the Divine, in the directing the good Use of our
Pleasures, and aiming at the furtherance of Virtue in all our
Actions.</p>

<p>Thus much for <i>Ringing</i>.</p>

<p><i><span class = "firstletter">I</span>taly</i> is asserted by
universal Consent, to have been the Country whence this Recreation took
its Birth and Original; and indeed ’tis no wonder that she who is called
the <i>Queen</i> or <i>Empress of the World</i>, the <i>Mistress of the
Nations</i>, nay <i>the Paradise of the World</i>, should yield such Art
and Ingenuity, and gentile Cunning, as her proper Product:
A&nbsp;Country whose Inhabitants for their <i>Gravity</i>,
<i>Respectiveness</i>, and <i>Ingenuity</i> will ever stand Chronicled
in the Books of Fame. A&nbsp;People that are <i>obedient</i> to their
<i>Superiors</i>, <i>Courteous</i> to their Inferiors, full of all
<i>Civility</i> to their Equals, <i>Affable</i> to Strangers, and most
desirous by all fair and friendly Offices to win their Love. In their
<i>Apparel</i> fine and modest, in their <i>Furniture</i> of their
Houses sumptuous, and at their <i>Tables</i> neat, sober in
<i>Speech</i>, Enemies of all <i>ill Reports</i> of others, and so
tender of their own <i>Reputation</i>, that whosoever Slanders any one,
and it reach the Parties Ear, the Slanderer
<span class = "pagenum">185</span>
certainly dies for it: <i>Thrifty</i> they are generally of their Money
and Expence, and love no more Cost, than what they are sure to Save by,
or have great Thanks for; but otherwise for civil Behaviour and
Deportment, surpassing all the Gentry of the World besides. But one
thing I dare not omit in this Character of them, <i>viz.</i> That they
are extream <i>Jealous of their Wives</i>; and indeed not without some
reason, if what is spoken proverbially of their Women, be true, That
they are as <i>Magpies</i> at the door, <i>Saints</i> in the Church,
<i>Goats</i> in the Garden, <i>Devils</i> in the House, <i>Angels</i> in
the Streets, and <i>Syrens</i> at the Windows; if Nature does not make
them appear Beautiful, Art shall, as Paintings and other sophistical
Helps; whence comes this Proverb among them, If <i>God make them tall
and Fat</i> (a&nbsp;<i>goodly</i> Woman being a Title of great Value
among them) <i>they will make themselves fair</i>. In fine, The Gentry
are very Rich, live of all Men the most careless and contented Lives,
keeping the Poor as Drudges and Slaves for them; and as it is said of
the Tyrant <i>Polycrates</i>, <i>Have nothing to trouble them, but that
they are troubled with nothing</i>.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">186</span>
<p>Thus I have given you a brief Character of the Inventors of this
Recreation we are coming to treat of, and hence we may presume, how
<i>fit</i> such a People as this is, to give Birth to such a Recreation,
so Gentile, so Cleanly, and so Ingenious, that as their Persons and
Manners are emulously esteemed, so are their Pastimes ambitiously
pursued, by most Nations in <i>Europe</i>; and this Sport is hugely
valued by all in general, few Noblemen’s or private Gentlemen’s
Families, nor few noted Towns in <i>England</i>, but have <i>Billiard
Tables</i>, and admire the Excellency of it, both for the Exercise of
the Body, and the Recreation of the Mind. But to the Matter in hand.</p>

<p><i>First</i> then, He that would rightly understand this excellent
Pastime, must be very careful of the <i>Form</i> and <i>Make of the
Table</i>, and the right ordering, framing, and fitting it for the Game,
which is known by these ensuing Marks.</p>

<p>1. The <i>Form</i> of a <i>Billiard Table</i> ought to be
<i>Oblong</i>, that is to say, somewhat longer than it is broad; Both
the length and breadth being left to your Discretion to make;
proportionable to the Room you design it for; It ought to be
<i>railed</i> round, and this
<span class = "pagenum">187</span>
Rail or Ledge a little swelled or stufft with fine Flox or Cotton, that
may yield to the Ball when struck against it, and expedites rather than
deads the Flight of the Ball; though that happens according to the
Violence of the Stroke or Push: The <i>Superficies</i> of the Table
ought to be covered with Green fine Cloath, clean and free from Knots:
The Board must be levelled as exactly as is possible for the Eye and
Hand of the most curious Joyner to Level, to the end your Ball may run
true upon any part of the Table, without leaning or declining to any
side of it: I&nbsp;must confess I do believe there are few have been so
careful in this last thing, as they ought, because they have not timely
foreseen, if the Boards, whereof the Table is made, be
<i>well-seasoned</i>, and not subject to <i>Warp</i>, and that the
<i>Floor</i> whereon it stands be even and level; so that through the
Ill-seasonedness of the one, or Unevennes of the other, as likewise in
time by the weight of the Table, and the Gamesters yielding and giving
way, there are very few found true. And indeed without a Table be
exactly true, a&nbsp;good Gamester can never shew the Excellency of his
<span class = "pagenum">188</span>
Skill and Art, but a very Bungler sometimes, by being well acquainted
with the Turnings and Windings of a false Table, may beat a good
Gamester with great vexation and shame, who otherwise would have given
him any odds whatsoever. Therefore let me tell you, it will conduce as
much to the Interest of the Master of the House, where a <i>Billiard
Table</i> is kept, to see that it be well and truly levelled and kept,
as it does to the Pleasure and satisfaction of a good Gamester, whose
Skill is best seen and exhibited on such Tables, and never comes
unattended with Company and Profit to the House, by his Recommendation
he gives abroad of it. And now let us proceed to the rest of its parts,
and fit it for our Play; and then let’s to’t as you list.</p>

<p>2. The four Corners of the Table must be furnished with <i>four
Holes</i>, and exactly in the middle of each side <i>one Hole</i>, and
these Holes must be hung at the bottoms with <i>Nets</i>, Which Holes
are named <i>Hazards</i>, because if either by Skill or Chance one
Gamester strikes anothers Ball into these Holes, or Hazards, as we will
now call them, he wins One; the <i>Nets</i> are made to receive
<span class = "pagenum">189</span>
the Ball, and keep them from falling to the Ground when hazarded; and
indeed is a very commendable way, far better than <i>Wooden</i> Boxes
which some use, these being apt to let a Ball to fly out again, when
they are struck in by a stiff stroke, whereas the Nets keep them safe,
and makes it impossible for them to rebound.</p>

<p><i>3dly.</i> The other <i>Utensils</i> and <i>Instruments</i>
belonging to this first part of our Observations of the <i>Billiard
Table</i>, are 1.&nbsp;An <i>Ivory Port</i>, this must be placed at one
end of the Table. 2.&nbsp;An <i>Ivory King</i>, which must stand at the
other end. 3.&nbsp;Two <i>Ivory Balls</i>, which must be compleatly
round, or no good proof of your Play can be expected. 4.&nbsp;and
Lastly, <i>Two Sticks</i> made of <i>Brasile</i>, <i>Lignum-Vitæ</i>, or
some other weighty Wood, to make them heavy, and at the broad end tipt
with Ivory: And be sure to observe narrowly, if the <i>Heads</i> be
tight and fast, for if they should be loose you will never strike a
smart stroke; and therefore if you fear this Defect, see if your stroke
be hollow and dead, and your Ball run faintly, these are infallible
Tokens that your Play will come to nothing without a fresh supply
<span class = "pagenum">190</span>
of other Sticks, or the heads of these fixt.</p>

<p>Thus much for the Table, and all the other Implements belonging to
it, which are necessary for our first Enquiry for the right
understanding of this Game, I&nbsp;come next to those <i>Rules</i> and
<i>Measures</i> which are to be observed for the rendring one a Gamester
at this gentile Game.</p>

<p><i>Secondly</i>, This Game in its <i>Number</i> is, according to the
<i>Place</i> and <i>Time</i>, when and where it is play’d; for in
Gentlemens Houses they do not oblige themselves to a certain Number, but
make as many as they please to admit up without any Restriction: But in
Houses where part of their Subsistence has a Dependance upon a
<i>Billiard Table</i>, the Game is <i>Five</i> by Day-light or
<i>Seven</i>, if odds be given, and <i>Three</i> by Candle-light, or
more, as the Rule of the House is. Now then having agreed upon what
number we play, let us learn next how to manage our Game skillfully and
with Art, and this we may understand by these following Rules.</p>

<p>1. Let us know who must lead, which thus is resolved: You must stand
on the one side of the Table opposite to
<span class = "pagenum">191</span>
the (so called) King, with your Ball laid near the Cushion, and your
Adversary on the other placed in the like posture; and thus He of the
two, that comes nearest the King, leads first.</p>

<p><i>2ly.</i> Having gotten the Lead, have a Care how you strike your
Ball, that at the first stroke you touch not with your Ball the end of
the Table, leading from the King to the Port, for if you touch it you
lose One, as you shall observe hereafter in the Orders. But after the
first Stroke you need not fear doing it: And you Leader be sure to lead
so, that you may be in a possibility of passing the Port the next
Stroke; or else to lye so cunningly, that you may probably hazard your
Adversaries Ball the very Stroke you play after him.</p>

<p><i>3ly.</i> Generally the first Contest is who shall <i>pass first
the Port</i>, and herein much Pains is taken, and all the Art and
Cunning possible used to do it, and sometimes, nay frequently, an
Opportunity of a <i>Hazard</i> ends the Controversy: Sundry and various,
as well as very pleasant, are the Policies and Tricks which are here
used to obstruct each others Pass, as; <i>By turning the Port by
<span class = "pagenum">192</span>
a strong clever stroke</i> (the Sticks turning it, it is nothing, but to
set aright again is the amends, though some would have the severity of
the Orders inflicted on such an Offence by the Loss of One:) Next by
<i>laying your Ball</i> (when you see it impossible to pass) <i>in the
Port</i>, or <i>before your Adversaries Ball</i>, for then let him do
his utmost, he must Pass after you; if he has Past first, and you dare
not venture to follow him, as fearing he should in the mean time touch
the King, and so carry away the End; then you must wait upon him, and
watch every Opportunity how you may hazard, or king him: Kinging of him
is, when his Ball lyes in so advantageous a manner, as that if you
strike his Ball, he must inevitably strike down the King, then you win,
and prevent the Loss of that End: But with this Caution however, That
you be careful how you strike, for if you do king him, and your Ball
happens to fly over the Table, or into a Hazard, you shall lose One
notwithstanding you have King’d him; and therefore a skillful Precaution
must ever be had in this, and he that would prevent any such Chance,
must</p>

<span class = "pagenum">193</span>
<span class = "folionum">K</span>
<p><i>4ly.</i> Have a <i>curious Eye</i>, and a <i>good Judgment</i>, to
take and quarter just so much of the Ball, that when he intends either
to King or Hazard his Adversaries Ball, he may with Facility &amp;
Dexterity effect either. Which Observation must be noted, in passing on
your Antagonists Ball, or corner of the Port: And indeed some are
curious Effectors of this part of the Recreation, who with less than a
fifth part of a Ball, will rarely miss a King or Hazard; which I must
confess is an excellent part of a compleat Gamester in this Sport.</p>

<p><i>5ly.</i> Be careful that you <i>lay not your hand on the Table</i>
when you strike, nor let your Sleeve drag upon it, if you do it is a
Loss; Or if you <i>smoke a Pipe of Spanish or Virginia</i>, being so
wedded to that Fume, that were you sure to smother all the rest of the
Company you are insensible of the Indecency, be careful that the Ashes
fall not on the Table, lest the Cloth be burnt, which many times falls
out: In these two Cases, let the Mulcts and Forfeitures of both, but
especially the Hinderance the last gives a Man in the Skillful managing
his Game, deter you from the lolling slovenly Posture of the first, and
<span class = "pagenum">194</span>
the stinking Indecency of the latter; because this Pastime being of a
neat and cleanly Composition, will not admit any such Irregularities and
Indecorums, without an absolute Violation of its Laws, and a Punishment
attending such unhandsome Offences.</p>

<p><i>6thly.</i> As this cleanly Pastime exacts our diligent Care of
keeping a <i>Decorum</i>, in the prosecuting the same, so does it
require that we handle our Instruments with a neat and tractable hand,
dislikes a Clumsey-Fist, which palms the Stick, as if he were handling a
<i>Plough-share</i>: And therefore when you strike a long stroak, hold
your stick neatly between your two fore-Fingers and your Thumb, and then
strike a smart stroak; and by taking a steady and right Aim, (in this
having your Eye and Judgment about you) you may when you list, either
fetch back your Adversaries Ball, when he lyes fair for a Pass; or many
times, when he lyes behind the <i>King</i>, and you at the other end of
the Table, you may by a dextrous management of your stroke, <i>King</i>
him backward: Both which ways, I&nbsp;must confess, require a great deal
of Care, and good Play, which
<span class = "pagenum">195</span>
<span class = "folionum">K2</span>
he that would be, or already is, a&nbsp;Gamester, is never wanting in.
But</p>

<p><i>7thly</i>, If you lye close, then the small end of your Stick, or
the flat of the big end, raising up one end over your shoulder, is
practicable and useful, and either of them to be used, as Occasion shall
require, and as you judge most convenient and proper for the working the
Effect you Aim&nbsp;at.</p>

<p><i>8thly</i>, There is one Fault, which tho its Demerits perhaps may
not reach a Forfeiture, yet I must tell you will scarce admit of an
Excuse, though this I presume is regulated according to the Agreement
first stipulated between the Gamesters, and this Fault is called
<i>Raking</i>, <ins class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘i,e,’"><i>i.e.</i></ins> not striking your Ball cleanly, but gliding
along, as it were; But in this, if you touch your Ball twice, it is a
loss; as indeed repugnant to all <i>Rule</i> and <i>Method</i>.</p>

<p><i>9thly</i>, There is another Caution you are to take at the Port,
<i>viz.</i> When you jobb your Ball with the great end of your stick
through the Port, beware that you throw it not down, the doing of it is
a loss; and therefore be careful to do it so handsomly, that at one
stroke without turning the
<span class = "pagenum">196</span>
Port with your stick (which as I have mentioned before is a fault) you
accomplish your Intention: But on the contrary observe</p>

<p><i>10thly</i>, It is good play to turn the Port with your
<i>Ball</i>, (not with your stick) and so hinder your Adversary from
passing: Nor is it amiss, to make your Adversary a <i>Fornicator</i> if
it lyes in your Power: I&nbsp;mean to make him a <i>Fornicator</i> is,
having past your self a little way, and your Adversaries ball being
hardly through the port, you put him back again, and it may be quite out
of pass, and so you may the sooner peradventure gain the end, having the
Advantage of passing, by gently thrusting the other back again.</p>

<p><i>11thly</i>, Let Policy likewise be a guide to you, for obtaining
the Conquest, and lying a-loof off, and laying a long Hazard sometimes
for your Antagonist, will be an excellent way to entice and entrap him;
for that he promising to himself the good fortune of Hazarding you, will
be induced rashly to adventure at that distance, and supposing to strike
your Ball, which cunningly lyes (to tempt him to that Venture) near the
Hazard, is himself caught
<span class = "pagenum">197</span>
<span class = "folionum">K3</span>
in that Trap he thought to throw you into, by reason that the distance,
deceives his Expectation, and blows up his thoughts with fruitless
Suppositions.</p>

<p><i>12thly</i>, Let Art likewise teach you Cunning, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>
by lying abscond, or at Bo-peep with your Adversary; this is a subtlety
which perhaps may gain the Advantage of a Pass or Hazard. For I must
tell you, in this Game, is required much Cunning, and subtle
Contrivance, as in any Recreation whatever, and therefore when you are
to Play with an Expert Player, you must muster up all the forces of your
Ingenuity and Wit, for the vanquishing of your Opponent.</p>

<p><i>Lastly</i>, Observe the Advantages may be gained, and endeavour to
get them, if they fall within the sphere of your Activity. One of which
I shall here insert, which is indeed the chief, <i>viz.</i> That if your
Adversary hath not past the Port, and lies up by the King, take the
Advantage of a Second Pass, endeavour to pass again, which if you
dextrously perform, and after touch the King, you gain two; but if your
too great Precipitancy and Inadvertency,
<span class = "pagenum">198</span>
or sometimes an unlucky Chance hurryes you on to throw down the King,
then you loose.</p>

<p>Some instead of a King use a string and Bell, so that after you have
passed, you need not doubt the end, as being a thing not so ticklish, or
requiring so much Art as the King does, to be toucht finely and gently
at a distance, without throwing it down: This alone is to be preferred
for ingenious Persons, the other for the use only of Bunglers.</p>
